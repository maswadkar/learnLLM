Like most other mathematicians, I tend to sort of evade the question, because it's tricky. Usually, the question is put in the form, \"Are you a platonist?\"\nThe reference here is to Plato's eternal form that we are able to recognize, and that allows us to recognize the world around us (it is not obvious, afterall, that we should still be able to recognize an amputee as a human when we first see him or her, for example). When forced to continue, I usually respond \"No.\"\nI think the fundamental problem with Platonism is summed up in Brian Davies's paper, aptly titled \"Let Platonism Die.\" I also add - if a mathematical 'discovery' hasn't yet been discovered, does it exist? A Platonist would say absolutely. An intuitionist would either say that it does not exist, or it exists only in the sense that some current or future mathematical system, devised and formulated vulgarly by humans, will lead to many more theorems - i.e. it exists only as an extension of what we have already created.\nBut ultimately, I don't think that this distinction is very important aside from the theistic or neural implications. A Platonist would say that when we recognize a triangle, for example, it is because we are recognizing the Form of a Triangle, some idealized, perfect, transcendental object. This makes a lot of sense, because Platonism obviously has at its roots Plato, who read much into the divine relationship between mathematics and the world espoused by Pythagoras. \nAs a final note, I should say that many well-known mathematicians lie on both sides of the fence. The most famous Platonist, I believe, is Roger Penrose, who is most famous for his creation of dozens of non-obvious tessellations and tilings.\n"}]}

We need math to represent that for us.\nJUst to further my point, consider Calculus.  Two people who were on completely different sides of Europe, Leibniz and Newton, created a system that that both do the same thing.  For Newton, f'(x) is the same as Leibniz' df/dx.  Both of them yield a function that represents the slope at any given point on the original function, f(x).

Of course, such an answer supposes that Euclid and Dedekind are talking about the same arithmetic. Is that even possible? No. There's no room, in Euclid's conception of number (think of Books V and VI of the Elements), for Dedekind's cuts, and thus, no room for a whole host of numbers that are incompatible with Euclid's concept of number.

The boundary is put at different places by different people. I put myself on the list and I believe that my position is objectively justifiable, and others are not.\nDefinitely discovered: finite stuff\nBy probabilistic considerations, I am sure that nobody in the history of the Earth has ever done the following multiplication:\n\n9306781264114085423 x 39204667242145673 = ?\n\nThen if I compute it, am I inventing its value, or discovering the value? The meaning of the word \"invent\" and \"discover\" are a little unclear, but usually one says discover when there are certain properties: does the value have independent unique qualities that we know ahead of time (like being odd)? Is it possible to get two different answers and consider both correct? etc.\nIn this case, everyone would agree the value is discovered, since we actually can do the computation--- and not a single (sane) person thinks that the answer is made up nonsense, or that it wouldn't be the number of boxes in the rectangle with appropriate sides, etc.\nThere are many unsolved problems in this finite category, so it isn't trivial:\n\nIs chess won for white, won for black, or a draw, in perfect play?\nWhat are the longest possible Piraha sentences with no proper names?\nWhat is the length of the shortest proof in ZF of the Prime Number Theorem? Approximately?\nWhat is the list of 50 crossing knots?\n\nYou can go on forever, as most interesting mathematical problems are interesting in the finite domain too.\nDiscovered: asymptotic computation\nConsider now an arbitrary computer program, and whether it halts or does not halt. This is the problem of what are called \"Pi-0-1 arithmetic sentences\" in first order logic, but I prefer the entirely equivalent formulation in terms of halting computer programs, as logic jargon is less accessible than programming jargon.\nGiven a definite computer program P written in C (or some other Turing complete language) suitably modified to allow arbitrarily large memory. Does this program return an answer in finite time, or run forever? This includes a hefty chunk of the most famous mathematical conjectures, I list a few:\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis (in suitable formulation)\nThe Goldbach conjecture.\nThe Odd perfect number conjecture\nDiophantine equations (like Fermat's last theorem)\nconsistency of ZF (or any other first order set of axioms)\nKneser-Poulsen conjecture on sphere-rearrangement\n\nYou can believe one of the two\n\n\"Does P halt\" is absolutely meaningful, so that one can know that it is true or false without knowing which.\n\"Does P halt\" only becomes meaningful upon the halting of P, or a proof that it doesn't halt in a suitable formal system, so that it is useful to introduce a category of \"unknown\" for this question, and the \"unknown\" category might not eventually become empty, as it does in the finite problem case.\n\nHere is where the intuitionists stop. The famous name here is\n\nL.E.J. Brouwer\n\nIntuitionistic logic is developed to deal with cases where there are questions whose answer is not determined as true or false, so that one cannot decide the law of excluded middle. This position leaves open the possibility that some computer programs that don't halt are just too hard to prove halt, and there is no mechanism for doing so.\nWhile intuitionism is useful for situations of imperfect knowledge (like us, always), this is not the place where most mathematicians stop. There is a firm belief that the questions at this level are either true or false, we just don't know which. I agree with this position, but I don't think it is trivial to argue against the intuitionist perspective.\nMost believe discovered: Arithmetic hierarchy\nThere are questions in mathematics which cannot be phrased as the non-halting of a computer program, at least not without modification of the concept of \"program\". These include\n\nThe twin prime conjecture\nThe transcendence of e+pi.\n\nTo check these questions, you need to run through cases, where at each point you have to check where a computer program halts. This means you need to know infinitely many programs halt. For example, to know there are infinitely many twin primes, you need to show that the program that looks for twin primes starting at each found pair will halt on the next found pair. For the transcendence question, you have to run through all polynomials, calculate the roots, and show that eventually they are different from e+pi.\nThese questions are at the next level of the arithmetic hierarchy. Their computational formulation is again more intuitive--- they correspond to the halting problem for a computer which has access to the solution of the ordinary halting problem.\nYou can go up the arithmetic hierarchy, and the sentences which express the conjectures on the arithmetic hierarchy at any finite level are those of Peano Arithmetic.\nThere are those who believe that Peano Arithmetic is the proper foundation, and these arithmetically minded people will stop at the end of the arithmetic hierarchy. I suppose one could place Kronecker here:\n\nLeopold Kronecker: \"God created the natural numbers, all else is the work of man.\"\n\nTo assume that the sentences on the arithmetic hierarchy are absolute, but no others, is a possible position. If you include axioms of induction on these statements, you get the theory of Peano Arithmetic, which has an ordinal complexity which is completely understood since Gentzen, and it is described by the ordinal epsilon-naught. Epsilon-naught is very concrete, but I have seen recent arguments that it might not be well founded! This is completely ridiculous to anyone who knows epsilon-naught, and the idea might strike future generations as equally silly as the idea that the number of sand grains in a sphere the size of Earth's orbit is infinite--- an idea explicitly refuted in \"The Sand Reckoner\" by Archimedes.\nMost believe discovered: Hyperarithmetic hierarchy\nThe hyperarithmetic hierarchy is often phrased in terms of second order arithmetic, but I prefer to state it computationally.\nSuppose I give you all the solution to the halting problem at all levels of the arithmetic hierarchy, and you concatenate them into one infinite CD-ROM which contains the solution to all of these simultaneously. Then the halting problem with this CD-ROM (the complete arithmetic-hierarchy halting oracle) defines a new halting problem--- the omega-th jump of 0 in recursion theory jargon, or just the omega-oracle.\nYou can iterate the oracles up the ordinal list, and produce ever more complex halting problems. You might believe this is meaningful for any ordinals which produce a tape.\nThere are various stopping points along the hyperarithmetic hierarchy, which are usually labelled by their second-order arithmetic version (which I don't know how to translate). These positions are not natural stopping points for anybody.\nChurch Kleene ordinal\nI am here. Everything less than this, I accept, everything beyond this, I consider objectively invented. The reason is that the Church-Kleene ordinal is the limit of all countable computable ordinals. This is the position of the computational foundations, and it was essentially the position of the Soviet school. People I would put here include\n\nYuri Manin\nPaul Cohen\n\nIn the case of Paul Cohen, I am not sure. The ordinals below Church Kleene are all those that we can definitely represent on a computer, and work with, and any higher conception is suspect.\nFirst uncountable ordinal\nIf you make an axiomatic set theory with power set, you can define the union of all countable ordinals, and this is the first uncountable ordinal. Some people stop here, rejecting uncountable sets, like the set of real numbers, as inventions.\nThis is a very similar position to mine, held by people at the turn of the 20th century, who accepted countable infinity, but not uncountable infinity. Those who were here include many famous mathematicians\n\nThorvald Skolem\n\nSkolem's theorem was an attempt to convince mathematicians that mathematics was countable.\nI should point out that the Church Kleene ordinal was not defined until the 1940s, so this was the closest position to the computational one available in the early half of the 20th century.\nContinuum\nMost practically minded mathematicians stop here. They become wary of constructions like the set of all functions on the real line, since these spaces are too large for intuition to comfortably handle. There is no formal foundation school that stops at the continuum, it is just a place where people stop being comfortable in the absoluteness of mathematical truth.\nThe continuum has questions which are known to be undecidable by methods which are persuasive that it is a vagueness in the set concept at this point, not in the axiom system.\nFirst Inaccessible Cardinal\nThis place is where most Platonists stop. Everything below this is described by ZFC. I think the most famous person here is:\n\nSaharon Shelah\n\nI assume this is his platonic universe, since he says so explicitly in an intro to one of his more famous early papers. He might have changed his mind since.\nInfinitely many Woodin Cardinals\nThis is the place where people who like projective determinacy stop.\nIt is likely that determinacy advocates believe in the consistency of determinacy, and this gives them evidence for the consistency of Woodin Cardinals (although their argument is somewhat theological sounding without the proper computational justification in terms of an impossibly sophisticated countable computable ordinal which serves as the proof theory for this)\nThis includes\n\nHugh Woodin\n\nPossibly invented: Rank-into-Rank axioms\nI copied this from the Wikipedia page, these are the largest large cardinals mathematicians have considered to date. This is probably where most logicians stop, but they are wary of possible contradiction.\nThese axioms are reflection axioms, they make the set-theoretic model self-similar in complicated ways at large places. The structure of the models is enormously rich, and I have no intuition at all, as I barely know the definition (I just read it on Wiki).\nInvented: Reinhard Cardinal\nThis is the limit of nearly all practicing mathematicians, since these have been shown to be inconsistent, at least using the axiom of choice. Since most of the structure of set theory is made very elegant with choice, and the anti-choice arguments are not usually related to the Godel-style large-cardinal assumptions, people assume Reinhardt Cardinals are inconsistent.\nI assume that nearly all working mathematicians consider Reinhardt Cardinals as imaginary entities, that they are inventions, and inconsistent at that.\nDefinitely invented: Set of all sets\nThis level is the highest of all, in the traditional ordering, and this is where people started at the end of the 19th century. The intuitive set\n\nThe set of all sets\nThe ordinal limit of all ordinals\n\nThese ideas were shown to be inconsistent by Cantor, using a simple argument (consider the ordinal limit plus one, or the power set of the set of all sets). The paradoxes were popularized and sharpened by Russell, then resolved by Whitehead and Russell, Hilbert, Godel, and Zermelo, using axiomatic approaches that denied this object.\nEveryone agrees this stuff is invented.\n"}]}

During the process of invention, one tries on a gazillion methods of getting the job done that don't work.  When one does discover a method that does work, well, one has an invention.\nThe proof of discovery verses creation, is the proof of reproduction.  When a person who has never seen a wheel before tries to solve the problem of causing heavy objects to move, he may very well re-invent the wheel.  This happens all of the time with inventions.  One comes up with a method of solving a problem, only to discover that someone else has patented that invention before him.  Creativity is not like this at all. If two people truly independently come up with the same creative product, then their creative product is, well, simple. In fact programs are used to analyze college papers for plagiarization.  They seek matches in a 7 word sequence because it is unlikely that two people independently come up with seven little words strung together the same way.\nSo let the question be, \"is mathematics discovery or creation?\"  Ask the anthropologist to seek out the mathematical methods of other cultures.

Quantity is just mass without numbers, and quality is just coincidence without observation.\nA response to another question I found here that spiked my interest:\n\nwhy does the concept of number exist, but the concept of complex number invented?\n\nThe concept of everything tangible and/or intangible only exists to be understood based on the reality and observation of the phenomenon around it, how those phenomena perceive it, agrees upon understanding it, and how well that system can accurately model the underlying reality of it. To a human a ball is something you kick, throw, catch, has shape, mass, volume; to a dog it's something in its way. The reality is that if there's a reality under the underlying concepts we try to figure, only such a system invented will try to emulate the process of understanding it more and more.\nThe question also touches on the grounds of everything around us, and its totality. Let me give you an idea of why I am proposing that math is an invention:\nBefore people could even count, or even existed there were always many different biological structures, masses, gases, inanimate objects, and collective existences outside of a singular model, single perception of electromagnetic radiation's visible light, eyeballs, brains, or classification itself. Before we evolved did dinosaurs, assuming you believe they existed, count and classify the world around them? Probably to a mere, limited extent, but not anywhere near how most people would think of it. All biological creatures that have evolved past the bacteria have gained perception, analyical minds, and the capability of complex thinking to become better suited to the existence to around them. None of them ever came anywhere close to modern humans.\nI doubt the fish in the sea can accurately model multiple perceptions of visible light on masses, and use their brains to visualize this as two separate objects, thus, manipulating the abstraction of items, beings, or existences around them. However, we look at two things and agree these are two things. We see two rubber balls on the floor, and we come to the immediate conclusion that they are two distinct objects. But are they really two things, or have you just subscribed to a common method to segregate objects based on human evolved, educated, or brain limited rules?\nPoint is, you see two non-connective items, and you classify/label them as two. You aren't, in most cases, visualizing the ball as a synthetic base of polymers, isoprene, and other chemical elements and masses that constitute its existence within electromagnetic radiation in an atmosphere. Therefore, you have classified the existence of two balls based on segregating instances of light, however, you are only using a system to do so that is 100% limited to your brain's understanding.\nWithout a system, understanding, or method of perception everything would exist, but would not be calculated, observed, or manipulated.\n"}]}

For example, different people can discover the Mandelbrot set, and various relationships and figures in there:\n\nIn the above image the colors are an invention, not a discovery. Different people will maybe choose similar coloring here, but I think it's pretty much an artistic choice. The colors roughly reflect how fast a point in the complex plane will head off to infinity under a certain repeated square-and-add operation, but they depend on a lot of parameters (including how many iterations one deems sufficient to establish the wayward nature of a point), including, of course, some particular color palette.\nI think this illustrates nicely that the very same mathematical beast can have aspects that are discovered, and aspects that are invented. ;-)\n"}]}

We invented a consonant by discovering a fact about ourselves.\nFrom this perspective, mathematics is a set of ideas to which humans are naturally attracted in a given way.  But those ideas themselves are a product of the human mind, the way the consonant 't' is a natural product of the human vocal apparatus.  Those ideas arise out of individual humans, who can be considered to invent them. (Someone first uttered the sound of t.  Someone first asked if -1 has a square root, or whether infinity comes in various sizes.)\nBut mathematics chooses out the ones that feel a given way and isolates those that appeal broadly to a given emotional reaction.  In that sense it is a branch of psychology which discovers things about human thought.\nIt elaborates those ideas to a degree that makes it seem like it is creating things, but really, it is exploring our shared fund of ideas for ones that seem purely symbolic and not worthy of questioning, and sees how their consequences fit together.\n"}]}

Human mathematicians are unable to invent anything logical which does not follow logically from human nature.\nThus, every mathematician can only discover what is already there, implicit in human nature, and since the mathematicians we know of are all humans, they will discover or rediscover the same things.\nThis is why mathematicians come to believe that it is a given, hence the Platonist view.\nThe Platonist view is wrong because while mathematics is given to every mathematician, it is not given to the human species. It comes with, or is part of, its own nature, so to speak.

One, you might be reducing the weight of your interests in any kind of balancing that has to be done; if your suicide is going to break someone else's leg (which jumping off a building might!) then atomizing you with a ray gun on the way down is probably more than justified even if it thwarts an exercise of your autonomy. Two, if your suicide looks like an accident, good samaritans will probably feel free to do all kinds of bodily invasive things to save you, if they think you can be saved, and I think that this is reasonable by most people's lights.\n(There are plenty of philosophers who would say that preventing a suicide is an act of good samaritanship even if you know the person wanted to die.

This and many other factoids directly imply that consciousness is not so much a product of our brains but rather a product of complexity and connectivity.  \nFrom that perspective, the concept of consciousness can both be reduced to the molecular level and expanded to the universe as a whole, with the universe as a very complex holographic quantum computer\nThe relationship with Animism\nIn Hinduism, death is understood as the collapse of the\u00a0\u0100tman (individual consciousness) and its dissolution into many different other components that make up the\u00a0Brahman\u00a0(universal consciousness).\nIf you look consider the\u00a0Trimurti\u00a0(the Hindu triniti), one can clearly see them as anthropomorphic representations of\u00a0nature\u00a0(Vishnu) and\u00a0its two fundamental opposite forces:\u00a0emergence\u00a0(Brahma) and entropy\u00a0(Vishnu). Similarly, many other\u00a0Devas\u00a0(Gods) are mere anthropomorphic representations of lesser natural phenomena.\nThe same applies to the\u00a0Kami\u00a0of\u00a0Shinto\u00a0religion or equivalents in other \"polytheistic\" religions. One could easily argue that all \"polytheistic\" religions are really\u00a0Animistic\u00a0religions, which are perfectly compatible with the Atheistic framework depending on how one defines concepts like \"Consciousness\" or \"Soul\".  \nPantheism and Shamanism as forms of Animism\nPantheism\u00a0is a simplified version of animism, which removes all \"Gods\" from the picture except\u00a0Vishnu\u00a0(nature).\u00a0Advaita Vedanta\u00a0is a form of Hinduism that belongs to this category. Many other religions (eg.\u00a0Germanic paganism) have a Pantheistic variation, although these advanced forms of religion are rarely known beyond a small\u00a0esoteric\u00a0circle of initiates. The\u00a0Traditionalist School\u00a0is a school of philosophers from the early 20th century that attempted to explore these esoteric religions and discover a\u00a0perennial philosophy\u00a0running throughout all religions.\u00a0Like Animism, Pantheism is also perfectly compatible with Atheism, again depending on how one defines concepts like \"Consciousness\" or \"Soul\".\nShamanism\u00a0is a variation of animism that involves the notion that the chemical modification of one's consciousness provides access to higher knowledge that is otherwise filtered from our perception. Shamanic practices do not require a belief in any \"Gods\" and are not uncommon among Atheist intellectuals, especially since the popularization of LSD and Mescaline in the '60s.\u00a0Aldous Huxley,\u00a0Ernst J\u00fcnger,\u00a0Alexander Shulgin,\u00a0Timothy Leary\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0Terence McKenna\u00a0are among the more prominent shamans in Western culture, although not all of them would use the term \"shamanism\" in reference to their\u00a0chemically induced self-exploratory consciousness expanding\u00a0sessions.\nThe Pantheistic \"God\" concept from the Atheist's perspective\nThe Atheistic naturalistic position of the universe as a very complex quantum computer is pretty much the same as the Pantheistic position of the universe as one highly advanced mind. The differences between Atheist naturalism and Pantheism are really more a matter of different semantics and different cultural bias than a difference in concept.\nIf one considers the notion that the clock ticks of a computer and awareness are basicly of the same nature (which is a perfectly reasonable consideration), the following statements would mean the exact same thing :\n\nThe universe is God. By being a part of God, all matter and living beings are essentially divine. Time is our perception of his thinking process. God's thinking processes comprise of all our thinking processes and all other processes of the universe combined. Our awareness is a tiny fraction of divine awareness.\nThe universe is a giant computer. By being operating systems somewhat autonomicly operating a part of that computer, all living beings are components of the same computer. Time is our perception of the giant computer sequentially processing information. The computer's sequential processing comprises of all our thinking processes and all other processes in the universe combined. Our awareness is but a tiny fraction of the universe's operating system.\n\nSo if time = awareness = clock ticks, I can't distinguish between those two statements. Conceptually they mean exactly the same.\nThe disconnect between Atheists and Theists largely stems from using very different semantical contexts to really describe the same perspective. If we were to adjust our semantics more to each other, many of us might see more similarities than they ever held possible.\n"}]}

Therefore to seek a state which does not infringe on the agency of its citizens is somewhat contradictory.\nThere are very few, if any, things a state does which do not constitute an infringement on agency.  You must pay taxes, you must pull over or get out of the way when you see flashing lights on the highway - you must follow the highway at all, you must respect other's property rights and you must not lie under oath, just to name a few.  These are fundamental functions of the state, to propose a state lacking these (sort of) functions is to propose nothing at all.\nAs such, it isn't useful to compare the actions of the state to the actions of individuals.  It is perfectly alright for the state to mandate you get out of the way when emergency vehicles need to get through on the highway, for instance.  It would be counterproductive, not to mention silly and inefficient, if anyone could do that whenever they pleased.\nAnd so, to address your question, as it is a necessary part of the state's role to infringe on agency, it seems highly unlikely to me that there is any way for the state to properly punish those who inhibit others' agency without in turn limiting the criminal's agency.\nNot to mention that the very word punishment could be defined as \"infringing on another individual's agency in response to a previous action on their part\", which would render your question the paradoxical \"how can the state infringe on individuals' agency without infringing on their agency?\"\nA related question that perhaps could be explored further might be \"When is it wrong for the state to infringe on the agency of its citizens?\" and this question has been, at least to American standards, been answered by The Deceleration of Independence, The US Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.  This question is, I think, the fundamental underlying question of any state which professes a duty to its citizens - that is to say any state which agrees with your \"supposition that we want to allow humans Agency\".\n"}]}

I have found myself in agreement with her concept of a reality in accordance with the Law of Identity; with reason as man's only valid source of knowledge; as life qua man as the essential principle of ethics; and as capitalism as the only political system commensurate with individualism, which is the most productive outlet for a social construct.\nHowever, Rand also explored subjects such as sexual philosophy (animalistic behavior), psychology (man is born a blank slate), and physics (determinism and no random events in the Universe) -- the latter two of which is clearly the product of popular scientific theory at the time. The fact is, in any conflict between a philosophy and science, science is the victor, and the philosophy needs to be adjusted. But since Rand is dead, and whether or not she left the philosophy of Objectivism to the hands of her student Dr. Leonard Peikoff is debatable, I would say that, for certain purposes, deviating from the school of Objectivist philosophy is necessary.\nIn sum, Objectivism and Randian philosophy are both terms that describe the exact personal philosophy held by the author and philosopher Ayn Rand -- the former of which describes the actual philosophy, and the latter a more derogatory term (as another answerer pointed out, it's like calling a Tea Partier a \"teabagger\"). Neither of these terms may describe most people today who call themselves \"Objectivists\" -- because, if you are a pseudo-Objectivist who only picks and chooses which of Rand's ideas you follow, you aren't an Objectivist -- and if you truly understand the messages she tried to convey, you would also understand what I have described, and you would have adapted a modern stance of Objectivism and would no longer be the philosophy frozen in time at Rand's death.\n"}]}

The Objectivists at ARI have generally taken the former view, while those at the Objectivist Center have taken the latter.  On the latter view, Rand's philosophy forms the core of Objectivism, but the philosophy is broader than her work, and includes later extensions and refinements by others who have developed it further in later material.\nWhy is this controversial, and a cause for argument?  I think it is fair to say that the Objectivists at ARI are concerned that people might end up modifying her philosophy in some essential way and calling their modified philosophy \"Objectivism\", which would be a misrepresentation.  On the other hand, those who view it as a broader system as less worried about this, and are of the view that it is better to conceive of this term as encompassing the broad philosophical system, unconstrained by the limits of what Rand herself discovered.\n(In regards to this issue, it is also worth noting that Objectivists tend not to use the word \"Randian\", and this term has generally been used by opponents as a sneer.  Personally, I don't take that term to be inherently insulting; after all, we refer to Kantians, Aristotelians, etc.  Nevertheless, it has been deployed in that way by critics of Objectivism, so it has come to be imbued with hostile intent.)\n\n** Incidentally, Rand also noted in her work that she would have preferred to call her philosophy \"Existentialism\" (owing to the fact that its first foundational axiom is that existence exists), but that name had already been pre-empted by the Existentialist philosophers, with whom she had major differences.\n"}]}

My background is in mathematics, and so my answer might seem amateurish from a philosopher's or logician's perspective.\nSufficiency\nI'll start with sufficiency, since it is easier. This answer is the same as those given. If p is sufficient for q, then, p is enough to have q. That is, if we have p, we have q, or\n\np \u21d2 q.\n\nNecessity\nThe statement \"p is necessary for q,\" means, we must have p to get q. In other words, if we don't have p, then we can't have q. In symbols,\n\n~p \u21d2 ~q,\n\nwhere I use ~ to denote negation. The logical equivalent, called the contrapositive, of this is\n\nq \u21d2 p.\n\nNecessity and Sufficiency\nThus, p is necessary and sufficient for q means\n\np \u21d4 q.\n\nAnother way this is commonly written is\n\np if and only if q. \n\nIt is sometimes abbreviated as\n\np iff q.\n\nExample of confusing a claim with its converse\nConsider the claim \"All dogs go to heaven.\" This means\n\nyou are a dog \u21d2 you go to heaven.\n\nThat is, being a dog is sufficient for entrance to heaven. The necessity statement, its converse, is this:\n\nyou go to heaven \u21d2 you are a dog.\n\nIt's possible that you might be a cat in heaven, and so this is not true. The only way this could be true is if there is a law that requires all dogs and only dogs to enter heaven. That is, being a dog is necessary to enter heaven.\nThis is also sometimes called confusing cause and effect. There is more explanation and examples on this website:\nhttp://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/confusing-cause-and-effect.html\n"}]}

Do not commit a fallacy of bifurcation thinking all conditionals must be one or the other.\nSufficient expresses that some element is able to satisfy the result. This means there are also OTHER means to also meet the same result. For instance a grade of 65 on an exam is sufficient to PASS the exam. Surely any score greater than 65 also passes.\nNecessary expresses that the result would be impossible to occur in the absence of a essential element. A triangle necessarily MUST have three sides. Any more sides or less sides, then you absolutely do not have a triangle.  Many people associate this conditional statement with cause & effect. As in science oxygen is necessary for combustion to occur or your standard chemistry balancing equation problems use the arrow to express this context. \nTo put conditionals another way we can use symbolic language to express these propositions in a clearer sense instead of the ambiguous arrow notation.  To say a is sufficient for b is to say it is possible that you can obtain b without a. That is ~a V b.  The tilde (~) represents a negation.\nTo say that you must have a to get b is to say it is impossible to get b without a.  That is ~(b & ~a). This is read as it is impossible to have b and also not have  a.\nSome examples:\n if you are saved, then you have salvation.  This expresses there is only ONE way to salvation. There are no others.  This is necessary. You would use the latter notation above.\nIf you are a citizen then you have unemployment benefits.  This expresses there are people who are eligible for unemployment benefits but all citizens do not automatically get benefits. Perhaps the law allows people on visas to collect unemployment benefits as well. It is a possibility that there are other conditions to grant the benefits.  We are given that one of the many accepted conditions is being a citizen. This is not mandatory.\nIf I shoot you with my gun, you will die.  This clearly is one way to die.  So you can also die by drowning, by poison, getting a main blood vessel cut and bleeding out, shark attack, thrown out of a sky scraper, etc. This is not mandatory or necessary but sufficient to cause death. \nIf someone is a woman, then she is a human being.  This is necessary by definition because it is impossible to have the traits of womanhood and not have the traits to be a human being. The fact that men are humans do not affect the truth if the conditional. As you know all humans are not women.  This is impossible to be otherwise or else you are using the wrong term.\n"}]}

Therefore, (P -> Q) -> (P => Q).The material implication 'P -> Q' only fails to hold true (i.e. outputs 'false') in the case where P is true yet Q is false, because something true cannot imply something false. For all the other options, the implication holds (true). Something false can imply anything, because from falsity anything follows; that is, something false can imply something false as well as something true. For more information, please research the principle of explosion, which states \"ex falso sequitur quodlibet\" which means in Latin: \"From falsity follows anything.\"\nP -> Q: \"P implies Q\"\nP => Q: \"P is sufficient for Q\".\nThe sufficiency of P for Q is equivalent to the necessity of Q for P; therefore...\nQ <= P: \"Q is necessary for P\".\nHere is an example to illustrate the difference between a necessary condition and a sufficient condition:\nNecessity:\nRex is a chicken. A chicken is a bird. Being a bird is a necessary condition for being a chicken, because without being bird, a chicken cannot be, i.e., being bird is necessary (needed/required/pre-requisite), etc. in order to be a chicken.\nSufficiency:\nBeing chicken is sufficient for being a bird. Being a chicken implies being a bird. It is enough for something to be a chicken to be guaranteed that it be a bird. A chicken will always be a bird.\nMoreover notice that:\nLet:\n\nC := being a chicken;\nB := being a bird; then,\n[C => B] <= logically equivalent to => [B <= C].\n\nThe sufficiency of C for B is logically equivalent to the necessity of B for C. Therefore, since a chicken is a sufficient condition for being a bird, being a bird is a necessary condition for being a chicken.\nNecessity and Sufficiency: What it means for something to be both a necessary and a sufficient condition for something else.\nFor the conditional P -> Q:\n\nOriginal implication:         [P -> Q]\nConverse of Original:         [Q -> P]\nInverse of Original:          [~P -> ~Q]\nContrapositive of Original:   [~Q -> ~P]\n\nNote that:\n\nThe contrapositive of the original is logically equivalent the\noriginal implication:\n\nThe inverse of the original is logically non-equivalent to the\noriginal.\n\nThe converse of the original is logically non-equivalent to the\noriginal.\n\nThe inverse of the original is logically equivalent to the converse\nof the original.\n\n\nP -> Q = 'P materially implies Q' = \"If P, then Q\" = Q if P. {Original}\nQ -> P = 'Q materially implies P' = \"If Q, then P\" = Q only if P. {Converse}\nWhen both [P -> Q] and [Q -> P] hold; that is, when 'P implies Q' and 'Q implies P': \"P and Q imply one-another\". Here, P and Q biconditionally materially imply each other. The symbol (<=>) denotes 'material biconditional'; that is the conjunction of the original conditional and its converse.\nThe original conditional \"If P, then Q\" is a material conditional which can be expressed as:\nOriginal: P -> Q = \"If P, then Q\" = 'Q if P'\nConverse: Q -> P = \"If Q, then P\" = 'P if Q' = 'Q only if P'\nTherefore, the conjunction of the original conditional ('Q if P') and its converse conditional ('Q only if P) yields:  'Q if and only if P', which is logically equivalent to its converse 'P if and only if Q.\nThe term \"if and only if\" is abbreviated 'iff', where 'iff' stands for the logical biconditional, also known as \"material equivalence\", and is realized through an exclusive-nor, i.e., the \"xnor\" operator, the logical complement of the \"xor\" operator (exclusive disjunction). The \"xnor\" operator sets up a material biconditional in which a bidirectional (mutual) implication holds between P and Q: 'P <=> Q'.\nIf P and Q materially imply one another and then this bidirectional implication is called \"material equivalence\" is denoted by the symbol (\"<=>\"), and it sets up a logically biconditional if-then statement; where (\"<=>\") is implemented via \"xnor\", the logical complement of \"xor\".\nThe operator \"xnor\" is called the exclusive-nor. This operator (\"xnor\" = \"iff\" = \"<=>\") is called exclusive joint denial. The \"xnor\" operator only outputs a truth value of 'true' when P and Q are either both true together or both false together. The \"xnor\" operator logically excludes the remaining options in which exactly one of P and Q is true and the other false. The \"xnor\" operation between P and Q outputs only the truth value of 'true' when P and Q have the same truth values, and outputs 'false' when P and Q have different truth values.\nThe following three lines are logically equivalent:\n\n(P <=> Q) = [(P -> Q) and (Q -> P)] = [(P -> Q) and (P <- Q)]; where\nit follows that...\n(P <=> Q) = ['P is sufficient for Q'] and ['Q is sufficient for P'];\nand\n(P <=> Q) = ['P is sufficient for Q'] and ['P is necessary for Q'].\n\n"}]}

It is like a knot in the thread, trying to untie itself.\nHow can you understand, truly, if \"you\" is dreaming, or if \"you\" is part of a coherent, greater reality?\nWell, you should not rule out the simultaneity of yes/no, and the non-possibility of simultaneous yes/no, either.  These questions transcend the foundational assumptions of Science and Philosophy, and it is perhaps more intuitive to adopt a \"flexible\" set of fundamental thoughts, since it seems like we really want to talk about Awareness.\nHow Aware is one of a dream?  You may be engaged in it quite forcefully, invested all your \"chips\" and have many Possessions, Achievements, Feelings and Thoughts all within this \"sand box reality.\"  Then, one wakes up and all understanding of gain, all benefits stemming from self-concern (concern for personal wealth, personal happiness) go poof.  Gone.\nThe \"memory\" may persist, but in reality there was nothing \"real\" about the dream.  Maybe it hurts to be apart from personal happiness, but really it shows something very interesting:  Based on our observation of the situation, our feelings changed.  If we could understand the deeper truth of how Dreams/Reality inter-played, perhaps we could understand more about how Reality/\"Beyond\" might inter-play.  Since, if Reality is a dream, there should be something that transcends it in all directions... When one \"wakes up\", perhaps a similar \"poof\" may occur to all our cravings and attachments (all our foundations of personal/self-awareness).\nWe are constantly confronted with the self/non-self duality in daily life: we are a consistent, rhythmically breathing piece of the greater universe, yet we feel separated at large.  Really, we observe from a \"personal\" point of view, but the universe itself is still greater than us all, and certainly contains \"us\".  We are all of the same fabric, and all teammates playing for the same team.  Perhaps it is a strange dream...\nIf it is a dream, how does one wake up?  Well, this \"awakening\" is commonly referred to as \"Enlightenment\" and it is said to come from a deep inner understanding of the \"true nature of things\" -- to really understand yourself as a harmonious part of the universe, to not view others as \"others\", and to really come to grips with the transience/temporary nature of \"life\".  One knows \"Enlightenment\" like one would know Hot and Cold -- it is perhaps one of the few desires founded on wisdom and it is the desire to \"liberate the mind.\" \nHow does one get there?  What does it mean?\nWelcome to the Matrix, here are your introductory pondering questions; try and resist the urge to cover them with thoughts and words (be \"silent\" in there!), and let the \"self\" contemplate these things in the tranquility of the peaceful, unobstructed mind:\nEverything changes.  Nothing is permanent.\nAround you, there is infinite creation and infinite destruction in every moment.\nHappiness is actually awesome.\n\"I\" strives to be happy and understood.  True happiness comes from within, since all originates from the \"mind\" and this \"observational\" point of view.  Consider that you can reflect negativity or happiness to the environment and those around you.  Stuff you reflect gets reflected back eventually.\nContinuity of the \"one\" object.\nWe say the universe is made of pieces-parts, but really, you could never just delete a planet from the universe and still call it the universe.  You'd compromise the \"structural integrity\" in a way, but really you would be changing a lot in order to make sure one planet got \"deleted\" because it's all part of one continuous flow, and you'd need energy that was somehow \"extra\" energy -- energy that was beyond all the types of energy our universe is used to.  Something that could both ease the flow and \"remove\" things...\nDivisions of objects/things:\nEvery \"object\" that one can identify is just an agreed-upon convention for naming/communicating.  Really, at any instant, you can't say that \"you\" is made of the same atoms, feelings, thoughts, or state of mind.  Everything is in flux, so where is \"you\"?  Where is any object?  It is founded in the mind, and if you get good at watching/observing your own mind, you can start to understand the \"formation\" of desires and the \"formation\" of perception of objects (reification).\nUnderstanding that the observer is still a part of the \"observed\" is a good place to start in trying to attain the insight you want, I think.  Everyone's approach is different, although sometimes there is significant overlap in coming to \"true understanding\" between people and methods.  Really, the process of living is finding out which method is right for you.  If you hear something wise, and believe it to be so, do not discredit it due to the source.  A dog's bark might enlighten you one day, you never know what your spark, what your trigger may be.\nThe more you contemplate it, the more you will be able to explain to others your ideas.  Really, you should be patient until you feel like you've found the right question to ask.  Even if you have access to omniscient wisdom, it's all about asking the right questions.\n"}]}

The central question in that book is how the self, the apparently stable core of identity and consciousness, is constructed; that involves understanding what purposes it serves, and understanding situations of incomplete consciousness and identity, such as dreaming.\nMost often, when we are dreaming, we don't know that we are dreaming, but it quickly becomes obvious to us when we are fully awake that we were dreaming. Metzinger spends some time discussing lucid dreaming, in which case someone is conscious that they are dreaming. He mentions in passing some techniques for increasing the likelihood of lucid dreaming: mostly developing routines of checking for inconsistencies in one's environment and in the sequence of events, in hopes of following one of these routines within a dream, noticing inconsistencies, and persisting in the dream while more conscious.\nAn idea Metzinger develops is that human consciousness and sense of identity is a model of reality that is actively constructing from sense data, checked for consistency, and with our physical sense of our bodily processes as a sort of carrier signal that allows for a central point of reference. Call this model-0; we are capable of creating alternate models, and comparing them to model 0, which both requires the ability to immerse oneself in alternate models and the ability to recognize which one is model 0; that recognition depends upon one's innate sense of their own body and their recognition of the consistency of experience.\nI suppose you might imagine that there is a model -1, in which one is more conscious than one is in model 0, just as one is more conscious in model 0 than when dreaming. While I don't think this can be absolutely disproven, I would suggest that we can describe our awareness of our relative level of consciousness as a curved line that approaches a horizontal asymptote. Even in dreaming, when we don't realize we are dreaming, we know that continuity and consistency are lacking, and our sense of our own physical state is very distant, but these qualities can vary quite a bit even within a dream. When awake, we know our level of consciousness varies, but there is a much less dramatic difference in the range, and we know that when we are calm, well-rested, comfortable, and alert, we are about as conscious as we can be; we can tell by our own internal state that we're approaching that horizontal asymptote.\n"}]}

Very roughly, the idea is that there is nothing which could count as misapplying a word used to refer only to an internal mental state. Correct and incorrect depend essentially upon external frames of reference as reflected in the responses of others.  The argument is targetted at empiricism, but it is clearly applicable to the skeptic who claims we are dreaming, for it would be impossible, if Wittgenstein is right, to ever refer to one's own dream experience if dreaming was all one ever knew.\nSemantic externalism is a doctrine associated with Davidson, Putnam, Burge and to some extent, Kripke. This is the doctrine that it is an essential component of language that it is not an internal psychological state, that meanings must be grounded in a shared, external world. When you speak words I must take you as referring to something common to both our worlds, or else there would be no basis for successful communication.  A shared, outer world is a precondition of communication. The idea is similar to Wittgenstein's. \nI have not presented either argument in any detail, but really have just sketched them in order to answer the question.  They are anti-skeptical arguments which apply equally to the claims that we are dreaming, decieved by a demon, or are a brain in a vat.  They are widely accepted as effective in proving that any language user cannot have always been dreaming, always deceived about the reference of his words, for language must have been learned in a shared environment.  But the arguments cannot really show that I am not dreaming or hallucinating right now.  They do however try to show that deception cannot be the norm.\n"}]}

Then you'd probably want to consult lucid dreaming books with tips on reality checks.\nHere seeing the mind as on or off is a first order approximation: you can realize you are dreaming and know that the real reality is different from what you experience\nFor the second kind of reality: it doesn't really hold as a property for your mind as a whole and much more refinement is needed: the belief that your keys were in your pocket was incorrect, so it's a per statement property.\nScience can be seen as the simulator of all observations not just from human senses but also from measurement sensors, we try to interpret the data in multiple ways, and we sometimes find ourselves hampered by unsuitable frameworks. i.e. societies have actively dreamed of witches and hunted them down.\n"}]}

To paraphrase, the problem is the abstract notion of certainty which doubt demands all be measured against.

The question \"Could I be dreaming?\" is a question asked in doubt.  The answer Kierkegaard gives is that doubt cannot overcome itself: \n\nIf I want to keep on doubting, I shall never in all eternity advance\n  any further, because doubt consists precisely in and by passing off\n  that certainty as something else.  If I hold on to the certainty as\n  certainty for one single moment, I must also stop doubting for that\n  moment.

It's where we were thinking on waking life, but actually we were still dreaming about our waking life.\n\nSecond understanding: The question asserts \"How can we know that we are not placed on reality that are completely different but fake?\"\n\nThis understanding asserts condition that we are living on completely different scenarios of life and we are considering it is a continuation. For example: somehow we were awake and saw anything different and somehow we knew that might be it's because of an earthquake. The question is, are we living now at the same place or at different realm?\n\nThird understanding: Dream realm is something less real than another realm (that may be considered as real as it should be). Regarding to this understanding, the question may be interpreted as \"How does one know one is not placed on environment that less real than what it should be\"?\n\nThis understanding gives consequence, that even when we were succeed placed outside dreaming, again, we should ask, whether we are placed on different dream realm or we are now living on reality as it should be.\n\n\nContinuation as It should be\nThe key to response these situations by understanding that:\n\nWhether we are living on fake reality or we are living on something that less real as it should be (whether we don't know how for something must be considered as real as it should be), but one thing we have to be sure that there are continuations from our past life (past scenarios) to our current life (current scenarios).\nContinuation as it shouldn't be, is the real fake living. Whether we always know that our life are entirely duplications but as long as our continuations are as it should be, then everything are as it should be.\n\n\nTherefore, asking \"how do we know we are not dreaming?\" must be interpreted (equal to) as asking \"how do we know that this current life is the real continuation from the past life as it should be?\"\n\nDifferent degree of comparison\n\"How do we know that this current life is the real continuation from the past life as it should be?\" \"How do we know that this current life is the fake continuation?\n\nThe essence is based on how far we can achieve the degree of comparison. This determines how far we can distinguish a fake continuations from the original continuations.\n\nIt can be provided by switching our awareness to get possibilities to know (make comparison) whether there are wrong continuations. And this degree of comparison to make comparison can be created through:\n\nAutomatic switching awareness by practicing \"reality check\" by ourselves\n\nIf we want to know whether this current life is fake, we must conditioning ourselves to always asking \"whether this reality is fake\", and when we are sifting to a different reality, our subconscious will remind us (automatic switching quickly) to ask (know, make comparison) whether this reality is fake or not. It will gain our awareness to make a comparison whether there is another reality other than what we are experiencing. \n\nAutomatic switching awareness by practicing \"reality check\" by someone else (expert)\n\nIf we want to know whether this current life is fake, we need someone else to sit beside us and ask to see whether there is unusual behaviour to our awareness that may endanger our life (by checking unusual pattern from EEG - ElectroEncephalographym) or whether we are living within dream realm too long enough, and further someone else may force us to awake (automatic switching) and may be it leads us to ask (know, make comparison) whether this reality is fake or not. It will gain our awareness to make a comparison whether there is another reality other than what we are experiencing, or we just simply awake from dream state.\n\nManual switching by ourselves\n\nWe can do manual switching from current operating system to the previous operating system or any kind of operating system by disconnecting our awareness manually from operating system through focus.\n\nThrough focus, we can put our awareness at balance point where we can know (make comparison) that there are wrong continuation in this current life compared to unfinished tasks left behind within previous operating system.\nPractically, we can focus on something on dreaming, then (if we succeed) something that we are focusing on it, gradually will be changed or morphing and eventually will switch us into the waking state where we can deal with continuation as it should be.\n\nThe points are:\n\nWe can know whether we are dreaming or not by providing true comparison (not fake comparison) whether we are living with continuation as it should be or not.\n\nIt can be provided by switching our awareness through reality check or\nFocus on something. Practicing meditation will help us to switch (escape) our awareness from current state of realities to different realm or to waking state, where we can deal with our continuation as it should be.\n\n\nWithout these, we may be drawn into fake believe (we believe that we are not dreaming, but actually we don't realize that we are still dreaming).\nIt's not about \"we are not dreaming\" or \"we are dreaming\", but it's about we are living with continuation as it should be or not. This understanding not only put us on awareness whether we are dreaming or not, but this understanding lead us to be open minded to accept any possible realities whether we are dreaming or not and put us away from fake responsibilities for others and for ourselves. It's the essence of living.\n"}]}

E. Moore has a lovely little paper called A Defense of Common Sense that has important implications for your question. The basic idea is easy to grasp. \nThere are a variety of skeptical scenarios that seem to undermine claims to possess some kind of ordinary knowledge. The dreaming case you mention is one such scenario. Descartes's Evil Genius case is another. The Brain in the Vat case is yet another. The kind of ordinary knowledge that these skeptical scenarios are meant to undermine are just basic claims that people would ordinarily take to be obviously true like ``I know that I have hands''.\nAll of these arguments work like this: \n1) If I do not know that I am not dreaming, then I do not know that I do not know that I have hands. (Premise)\n2) But I do not know that I am not dreaming. (Premise)\n3) Therefore, I do not know that I have hands. (1,2 modus ponens)\nNow what Moore does is to turn this argument on its head. He argues:\n4) If I do not know that I am not dreaming, then I do not know that I do not know that I have hands. (Premise)\n5) I do know that I have hands. (Premise)\n6) Therefore, I know that I am not dreaming.\nNow, there are two clever things about this is this little argument of Moore's. The first thing is that it challenges the Skeptic to give us some reason why it was supposed to be true that we don't know we aren't dreaming. The skeptic would presumably say that Moore's argument begs the question, since the skeptic holds that a person cannot know that they have hands. However, Moore quite rightly points out that the Skeptic can't just stipulate that nobody knows this, or the Skeptic herself would have begged the question. So the skeptic needs to give an argument why it is supposed to be the case that nobody knows they have hands. Here's one thing a skeptic could say.\n7) For every person S, and every truth p, S knows p if and only if S is able to prove p. (premise)\n8) But, nobody can prove that he or she has hands. (premise)\n9) Therefore, nobody knows that he or she has hands. (from 7, 8 by universal instantiation and modus ponens)\nNow, Moore agrees with (8). He isn't claiming that it is possible to prove that one has hands. What Moore disagrees with is (7), the claim that something is knowable only if it is provable. That simply isn't the case, says Moore. There are things we know but can't prove and that's just a basic fact about the nature of knowledge. All of our knowledge of the world begins with our interacting with the world and gaining information by means of perception. Some of those beliefs we get about the world by perception are basic and simply must be correct, he calls these `commonsense beliefs' and says that ``I have hands'' is just one such item of knowledge. But if I do know that I have hands, then I also know that I am not dreaming, just as (6) says.\nThe second interesting thing about Moore's position is that Moore argues that it isn't a matter of choice whether one is going to accept commonsense or not. Moore's view is that every claim to knowledge--including the skeptic's claim to know that (7) is true!---begins from such commonsense beliefs. So, the question isn't whether we are going to accept common sense or not, but whether were are going to accept commonsense AND skeptical scenarios that conflict with common sense.\n"}]}

So lets try the following to (hopefully) gain experience. See it as me proving to you that you can discern between states of dreaming and states of wakefulness, I can't just do that with solely you reading text I typed, you have to do something. This is based on the assumption that reality is more than just intellect. The other (right) half of your brain is also involved in processing your reality, and that is the emotional/experimental aspect. So do the exercise below, please:\n\nClose your eyes in a quiet place and think of how you want to feel and notice your bodily sensation.\nJust keep thinking/feeling about it, you will start feeling it.\nYour mind will wonder of (otherwise you are an super evolved mind already and you probably wouldn't be here). This is exactly like dreaming, you have lost control and are self-reflecting less. Angst/worries take away your focus: (thoughts about work, mortgage, a fight with your spouse, whatever).\nFocus back on how you want to feel and notice your bodily feeling (changing) again.\nKeep on doing this (and let yourself fall asleep).\nDo this with a lot of will power for some time that feels right.\nYou will increase the frequency of self reflection drastically and you will likely wake up in a dream scenario one night where you gain conscious control of your environment to some extent, known as lucid dreaming.\n\nThis is something you can teach yourself, just like playing the piano. The point of this is that you self-reflect that you are not doing anymore what you want to do and get back at it. Google on \"lucid dreaming and fMRI\" and you will have biological evidence that areas in the brain of self reflection are more active during lucid(conscious/awake) dreaming, than non lucid dreaming. That your mind is wondering of is because the angst/anxiety is controlling you (or you let it control you). First you will experience those fears that are just beneath the conscious surface. The more you practice the exercise above, the more angst you will discover that lies deep down inside you. When you know/experience they are there, you can do something about it, recude them, and take control. Can you imagine, that those fears that live deep down inside you, that almost never get to the surface, influence very much of your daily life experience? As long as there are others things controlling you (or you are letting them control you) you have less control than you could possible have: you are dreaming.\nThis has thought me that I am dreaming often throughout the day, while almost anybody would say they are perfectly awake and not dreaming at all. That is because I am not skilled enough yet to constantly think about what I want and act upon that. The exercise above gives me more control of experience life because I can put more into it of how I want it to be, because of reducing the fears. I even start living at night: consciously experiencing the dream reality. Its starts with playing around (like children learn their environment) but it becomes more than that. You can really practice overcoming fears and use strong willpower (intention) to create what you want and see the effects immediately.\nSo the give one concrete answer to your question: You know you aren't dreaming in some aspect when you have consciously created what you wanted in that aspect that has created synergy (more than there was). \nI use aspect because again, this isn't a binary state. It is not that you create all that you(with good intention) desire, or you create nothing at all. That would also imply there is an ending state. But combining stuff to create synergy is endless. It is fact you can create partially, step by step, what you desire: the house, spouse, children, work, quality time you desire, as long as it creates synergy. That is how your consciousness grows.\nLook up things like:\n\nMy Big TOE by Thomas Campbell\nDalai Lama and what he has to teach.\nIntention experiments on youtube or whatever.\n\n"}]}

The same faculties function when we dream and when we are awake, but in one instance they are tense and in the other relaxed. The fullness of our mental life is in our dreams, but with a minimum of tension, effort, and bodily movement. We still perceive, still remember, still reason; all this may abound in dreams, for in the domain of the mind, abundance does not mean effort. What requires effort is precision of correspondence...The dreamer does not have the ability to make this effort. That is the one and only difference between him and a man who is awake.\nFrom this basic difference many others could be deduced...[Notably]:\n\n\nthe incoherence of dreams\n\n\nSince a dream characteristically exhibits, not a perfect correspondence but rather some variance between memory and sensation, quite different remembrances might be suited to the same sensation.\n\nThus often leading to a sense of absurdity.\n\nthe abolition of the sense of time\n\n\nA dream can offer us in a few seconds a series of event which during the waking state would occupy whole days...In the waking state we live our lives in common with our fellow beings; attentiveness to this external, social bond holds sway over the succession of our internal states.\n\nBergson compared the lack of precision of correspondence normally experienced with the passing of time, to a clock without a pendulum. Lacking a regular sense of timing of events, the dreamer\n\n...is no longer capable of the attentiveness to life necessary for regulating the inner according to the outer, for fitting inner duration perfectly into the general duration of things.\n\n\na shift from conscious to subconscious memories\n\nHere, Bergson departed from the 'current' (1958) theory, that had us dreaming mainly about events that have especially preoccupied us during the day. He claimed that sleep filled with such dreams leave us exhausted, therefore it can't be normal or natural, since sleep is supposed to be recuperative.\n\nIn normal sleep our dreams relate rather...to the thoughts that have flashed by us like lightning or to objects that we have perceived almost without awareness. If we dream of events of the same day, the most insignificant facts, not the most important ones, will have the best chance of reappearing.\n\nBergson gave as an example of how we might dream about subconscious rather than conscious memories:\n\nI was waiting beside the the tracks and was not in the slightest danger. Nevertheless, if the idea of possible danger had crossed my mind just as the streetcar came by...if my body had instinctively recoiled even though I was not conscious of feeling any fear, that night I might have dreamed that the streetcar was running over me.\n\nSo a skewed sense of time, an absurd feeling of incoherence, and a tendency to dwell on subconscious rather than conscious memories -- probably means you are dreaming.\nConversely (to answer the question directly), you should know that you are not dreaming if:\n\nyour sense of time is regular, and corresponds with the people and things in your environment;\n\nyou experience a coherent sense of reality, i.e. things and people look and behave normally or at least typically; and\n\nyou have no trouble focusing on conscious memories, without the intrusion of predominantly subconscious ones.\n\n\nThe World of Dreams, by Henri Bergson (1958), pp 51-57\n"}]}

Take for instance when someone who wakes from a dream gives an anecdote regarding what may have occurred within it, a common one for example, being flight. If we accept this anecdote we can then say that flying is something that one could only do in a dream since we are unable to do so while awake. In other words, there is room for one to conduct a comparative analysis as some people here have already mentioned and if there is no difference and all is the same then we probably would not be able to make any distinction to begin with that would enable one to pose the question. This may be a bit oversimplified of an assessment but I think it captures the essence of the point.\nA precedent to dreaming would be \"watching the back of your eyelids\" for X amount of time. There is corresponding brain activity and even bodily reactions to dream events like \"hypnagogic jerks\" and sleep-talking that signify that a subject truly is \"experiencing\" something. So there is causality. When you think about it, all language utilized by subjects who generate an anecdote of a dream all signify various dimensions of space. If one states that they had taken flight then it must have occured within a space of some sort (or a \"simulation\" thereof?). If that is the case then one could say that they are occupying two spaces at once or are in a state of simultaneity: asleep in bed (space 1) and navigating throughout the Dreamworld (space 2). If experience of the latter were to leak into the former while you are awake then there would be a chance that you would end up becoming institutionalized if you were to lose the ability to distinguish one from the other.\nAll of this points at what would appear to be a violation of physics for one cannot fly here without an apparatus. But if there is nothing but physics how could this be? In dreams, if it is not of a memory that one relives then it is of a wish wanting to be fulfilled or the reification of some fear that one may have or maybe some combination of all of these in some elaborate abstraction. This would signify a relief or restriction of various degrees of freedom.\nSo, a question one could ask is: what is it that I am capable of doing in a dream that I otherwise would not be able to achieve while awake? If you can come up with an example or two then these would be indicators that would enable you to tell the difference between states that you find yourself in. Much honesty and scrutiny required in the process.\n"}]}

Either you are able to tell you are not dreaming or you are not, and which it is most plausibly depends on the nature of the human brain. If human beings couldn't normally tell they are not dreaming, the species would have long disappeared.\nHow exactly we are able to tell is a very interesting question, but you better ask a cognitive scientist, not a philosopher.\nTo understand the philosophical question, in the sense that it is asked here, requires us to accept the premise that when we have the impression that we are awake and not dreaming, we do not actually know that we are awake and not dreaming. This in fact does not make any sense. Dreaming and being awake are both entirely and solely defined by our own personal experience. Nobody is going to tell us what it is to be dreaming and what it is to be awake. Different people may have had different experiences of dreaming and of being awake, but it remains true that each person understands these two states on the basis of their own personal experience of them. So asking if we may be unable to tell one from the other is absurd.\nThe question is philosophical only in the sense that answering it requires to think about the fundamentals of human cognition, but it is in essence a metaphysical question. We may just as well ask how we know that red is not green and green is not red. But why stop here. How do we know that what we all take to be colours are not ham sandwiches? And so more generally, how do we know anything?\nThe fallacy, then rest on the idea that knowledge is what Russell called knowledge by description. According to the theory of knowledge by description, a description is knowledge if it is somehow true of the real world. Knowledge by description probably doesn't exists but this is beside the point. The point is that what Russell called knowledge by acquaintance isn't knowledge by description. In the case of knowledge by acquaintance, there is simply no description, and therefore there is no description that could be true or false of the real world. In other words, it would not make sense to ask whether what we know by acquaintance may be false. It would also not make sense to ask whether what we know by acquaintance may not be a fact.\nWe can always muse that we are totally deluded as to what we know. Once we exclude knowledge by description as irrelevant, what is left is knowledge by acquaintance, and knowledge by acquaintance is self-evident. We know pain as pain. We know redness as redness. Pain is what we know as pain. Redness is what we know as redness. Could that be delusional? No. We may be deluded about the impression we may have that the redness we experience is the colour of a particular object, say, the cover of a little book, but redness stands for itself and pain stands for itself.\nSo being awake is precisely what it feels like being awake and dreaming is what it feels like dreaming. Other mental states, such as lucid dreaming for example, are something else. Humans may delude themselves in believing that \"real life\" takes place when they are awake, and they may delude themselves in believing that what they experience in dreams is not real. Yet, we defined reality itself as what we experience when we are awake. Being awake is itself defined by what it feels like to feel awake.\nHuman cognition does not consist in recognising pre-defined objects, entities or states. We don't start life by trying to decide which is being awake and which is dreaming. We experience both states and what we experience comes to define our experience of reality.\nHow do we know that what happens when we are awake could decide of our own personal existence, while what happens in a dream does not? Strictly speaking, we don't. We just come to infer that this is the case from experiencing both being awake and dreaming every day of our lives.\nWe know when we are awake because being awake is different from dreaming.\n"}]}

The two parts can't themselves claim to be \"philosophy\" on their own since the very name means lover of wisdom. Can the collector of first editions who never reads them be considered a lover of books? What about the woman who reads every book she finds at the library, but never owns one? What about the man who reads romance novels, but will never look at non-fiction? What about the reviewer who reads books for their job, but never for their own pleasure. Or the reader who never finds fault in what they read? No! The lover of books will not despise them in these ways.  In the same way, the true philosopher will not tire of seeking the truth.\nIt's been claimed that the work of philosophy can been distilled into the conflict between Plato and Aristotle.  Roughly speaking, the difference between the two can be found in the \"discovery\" portion of philosophy and thinkers of all sorts may be divided into the Platonic and the Aristotelian camps.  If you think from the abstract to the concrete (top-down) and believe that given a sufficient set of axioms you can deduce all truth, then Plato is your man.  On the other hand, if you start with observations of the world and use inductive reasoning to discover truth (bottom-up), you are a philosophical child of Aristotle.  Both men pioneered new territory in the tools of philosophy (abstract reasoning, logic, preservation of the ideas of previous thinkers, skepticism, and so on), but each remains relevant long after their specific ideas were shown to be wrong.  We remember them because of their unique approaches to how we discover truth.\nAll ages seem to have their controversies which seem to fall on lines drawn between the two Greek philosophers:  Anselm of Canterbury v. Gaunilo of Marmoutiers, Bertrand Russell v. Kurt G\u00f6del, Ren\u00e9 Descartes v. Blaise Pascal, Leonhard Euler and Daniel Bernoulli v. Gottfried Leibniz and Christian Wolff,  Bishop Berkeley v. Samuel Johnson,  Immanuel Kant v. David Hume, etc.  That's not to say philosophy hasn't moved on, but rather each bit of new ground has features that resemble the philosophical territory covered by those great Athenians from the 4th-century BC.\nMuch of the thinking that once fell under the banner of Philosophy has been pushed into more specialized disciplines.  Practically every department at universities can be traced back to philosophy at some point in the distant past.  Even the study of music (studied by Pythagoras and his followers), poetry (Aristotle wrote the book on it), political science (Plato's Republic is standard reading in both departments), and law (the Socratic method plays an important part in many law schools) can be seen as sub-disciplines of philosophy. If Mathematics is \"The Queen of the Sciences\"1, then Philosophy is her King.\n\nFootnote:\n1) It was too much a stretch to use the original Queen: theology.

But that is no more than to say: enforce the categorical imperatives without letting your interests be a factor in your decision.\nSimilarly, if you are a consequentialist, you may say that consequentialism forces you to be altruisitic by forcing you to renounce self-interest when the consequences so dictate.\nBut all these are no more than just 'notational' variations. I believe the question is not a valid question. I will explain why. As I see it you are asking the following question:\n\nWhich theory of moral philosophy forces others (sometimes by coercion) to act altruisitically? \n\nNow a 'theory of moral philosophy' could, by definition, be taken as a certain set of beliefs that promulgates a certain 'conception of the good'. Altruism is, by definition, a type of selfless behaviour that aims to promote the good of others. With these definitions in mind we can rephrase the question as follows:\n\nWhich conception of the good forces others to behave in such a way that their sole concern is the good of others?\n\nAnd the answer to that question is: Those conceptions of the good that make such behaviour good. Which is to say: Those conceptions that make it good to determine behaviour according to the good of others. But here you can see that we have reached an impredicative definition: the 'good' is part of both the definiens and the definiendum. So no such moral theory can be provided wherein the forcing of good is considered good - without, that is, lapsing into incoherence.\nI think your question looks like a valid question - but take care to unpack the definitions and you will see that it makes no sense to argue or demand such a position without becoming incoherent.

Perhaps it is suits the coercer's morality to force an act of apparent altruism, simply because it can be done. \nIn the case however of the media publishing stories about the billionaires who are all standing together to persuade other billionaires to do some apparent good in the world, I suspect it may in part be that there are feelings involved of accomplishment, pride, and a need for a measure of validation for individual acts through the subsequent similar actions of peers.

When we long for something, our heart aches.\nBecause moderate pleasure did not compromise ataraxia, casual sex and good food were allowed.

E. Moore argued that whatever definition was given of an ethical property such as 'goodness' in terms of some scientific or metaphysical property X, it would not be a correct definition. If 'goodness' meant the same as 'X' then 'What has X is good' would be a triviality, and Moore thinks that such a sentence is never a triviality. Moore thinks that whatever characteristic X is, whether that of being approved by the speaker, by\n  most men, by fully informed observers, or being conducive to evolution, being pleasant, being as like the eternal as it is possible for a temporal being to be, or whatever else is suggested, it is always a significant question as to whether what has X is good. (J.J.C. Smart, 'Prior and the Basis of Ethics', Synthese, Vol. 53, No. 1 (Oct., 1982), 4.)\n\nCUDWORTH\nRalph Cudworth (1617-88), the Cambridge Platonist and definitely a pre-Enlightenment figure, is credited by Arthur Prior with a clear anticipation of the naturalistic fallacy : 'Prior relates how in the seventeenth century Ralph Cudworth used a Moore-like argument against the view that goodness is just obedience to the will of God or to the civil sovereign'. (Smart, ibid.)\nHUME\nParenthesis : Hume's relation to the naturalistic fallacy is a complex matter, not at all straightforward. But the emphasis on 'pre-Enlightenment' in the Question as originally worded indicates an assumption that the Enlightenment could be jumped because Hume, an Age of Enlightenment figure, so plainly belongs to the naturalistic fallacy's history. But does he ? \n\n... by the 1930s Moore\u2019s alleged naturalistic fallacy had come to be regularly\n  conflated with a more standard sort of unwarranted inference, from \u201cis\u201d propositions to \u201cought\u201d prescriptions\u2014usually traced back to David Hume\u2019s argument blocking inferences from factual to moral judgments. The former were made by the faculty of reason and pertained to \u201cthe real relation of ideas, or to the real existence of matters of fact\u201d; the latter by the passions, which perceive matters of fact as virtues and vices, which \u201cmay be compar\u2019d to sounds, colours, heat and cold\u201d and other secondary qualities in the mind rather than its objects. Although he did not use the word \u201cfallacy,\u201d Hume condemned such\n  inferences as logical errors and indicted almost all moral systems for committing them. There is no indication that Hume thought matters of fact were exclusively natural, and he offered a nuanced discussion as to how virtues and vices may be deemed natural or unnatural, depending on how those terms are defined.\nHow then did Hume\u2019s argument come to be identified with Moore\u2019s alleged fallacy\u2014 especially since by Moore\u2019s lights Hume himself was guilty of the naturalistic fallacy in deriving moral judgments from the passions? This is a genuine puzzle. A 1939 article by the University of Michigan philosopher William A. Frankena (who had studied with Moore at Cambridge) that valiantly attempted to sort out the conceptual mess provides valuable clues. Noting what strange bedfellows Hume and Moore made, Frankena pointed out that all they really seemed to share was a \u201cbifurcationist\u201d ontology of ethical judgments: just as Hume bifurcated \u201cis\u201d and \u201cought\u201d propositions, intuitionists like Moore asserted that \u201cethical characteristics are different in kind from non-ethical ones.\u201d There the analogy ended' ( Lorraine Daston, 'The Naturalistic Fallacy Is Modern', Isis, Vol. 105, No. 3 (September 2014), 581.)\n\nREFERENCES\nG.E.

Some impression of how the active mind appears reaches the passive mind and makes an imprint upon it. Then the active mind can act upon this imprint and submit it to logical or other a-priori models to glean information from it a posteriori. In a way, the active mind perceives itself, there is a loop of self-reference; but it would be more accurate to say that it is a hypothetical Ding an sich in its quality of being empirically observed (and thus affecting the passive mind), while it is something different, a subject, in its quality of carrying out pure apperception.\nIt is like looking through glasses into a mirror: on the one hand, the glasses constitute an object whose shape I observe in the mirror; on the other, they are the instrument through which I am looking. The glasses are both, in a way, but these two aspects of the glasses are two separate qualities that do not overlap. I can also observe in the mirror that my eyes look bigger than the rest of my face; from this I may conclude that the glasses magnify. I have now observed not only their shape as an external object but also how they work as an external object (i.e. magnifying), as something that can be observed. But I have not observed the way my looking through the glasses affects my impression of the frame of the mirror: that is a different perspective that does not overlap with their quality of being observable.\nSo, to translate it to modern philosophy, how can the mind be both object and subject, both perceiver and perceived? I'd say we cannot know how, because for that we'd need to know the mind as a Ding an sich. All we know is that these distinct aspects of it are completely different, with clear definitions that cannot be confused. They are just both linked to some unknowable Ding an sich, somehow.\nYou might consider this an antinomy, just like Kant's free will: from the internal, subjective perspective of reason, we exercise free will, when we decide to move our arms; from the objective, external perspective of observed perceptions, we do not, because whatever humans do is determined by the mechanical composition of our bodies and brains. And yet both free will and determinism are useful concepts. They are just two different perspectives, which appear contradictory, but are in fact quite compatible: each deals with its own sphere, and should not be applied to the other's sphere.\n"}]}

Kants philosophy of Transcendental Idealism tried to yield a compromise between empirism and rationalism at this time by formulating a dualistic philosophy with inherent known contradictions.\n\nIn Kant's conception, my apperception has necessary unity since all of\n  my representations must be grounded \u201cin pure apperception, that is, in\n  the thoroughgoing identity of the self in all possible\n  representations\u201d (B131\u20132, emphasis mine). By this he means that:\n(The principle of the necessary unity of apperception) It must be\n  the case that each of my representations is such that I can attribute\n  it to my self, a subject which is the same for all of my\n  self-attributions, which is distinct from its representations, and\n  which can be conscious of its representations (A116, B131\u20132, B134\u20135). \n[...]my ability to attribute representations to myself as subject of them is\n  pure, as opposed to empirical apperception. This means that I have this \n  ability not in virtue of Humean inner perception, or Kantian inner intuition,\n  but rather independently of any such empirical faculties.(Source)\n\nKant was convinced that self-consciousness and cognition can only originate from a separate transcendental I, the empirical apperception is necessary, but not sufficient to explain spontaneity:\n\nAs is known, Kant\u2019s Critique arrives at certain contradictions, the\n  resolution of which is the motive force of classical German philosophy\n  and leads to Hegel. In my view, foremost among these contradictions is\n  Kant\u2019s re-assertion (with Descartes) that human beings have innate\n  capacities, albeit awakened by experience, but absolutely independent\n  of experience; it is this assertion that is necessary to overcome the\n  absolute scepticism of the final product of British Empiricism,\n  (Berkeley &) Hume. However, these \u201ca priori principles\u201d are fictions.\n  Man does not stand apart from Nature, and nor is humanity just a\n  product of Nature, gifted with Reason. It is necessary to comprehend\n  the origin of this intelligence, and only by understanding its origin\n  can the dualism which Kant wished to overcome be transcended. (Source)\n\nAlso you have to consider on what knowledge of nature, animals, humans, mental disorders the reasoning of philosophers was based at this time. They thought of animals as totally mindless bio-cybernetic machines while only humans are capable of self-consciousness and spontaneity. So they were deeply biased to dualistc views, which of course based on our present knowledge in physics, evolution theory, neurophysiology is pretty laughable. We know of feral childs who behave like animals, we can control the motorics of mice with electrical brain implantations...Dualism is dead, current philosophy thinks mainly in monoistic concepts (physicalism/reductionism) of emergence and supervenience.\nYou can better understand and analyse this situation, when reading philosophers following Kant, like Hegel, who tried to overcome the flawed dualistic seperation of subject and object in the philosophy of Kant:\n\nHegel overcomes the problems of Kant\u2019s system by revolutionising\n  Logic. According to Hegel, Kant considers the question of knowledge\n  solely from the point of view of the subject-object relation, and in\n  so doing places the entire content of cognition on the side of the\n  subject, leaving nothing to the object. Instead of seeing appearance\n  as a barrier between subject and object, Hegel conceives of the\n  subject and object as a single entity. Kant, he says, like all those\n  who have gone before, first define the object and subject as separate,\n  push them together, and then prove that their only genuine existence\n  is as separate. For Hegel Appearance is a stage in the process of\n  self-distinction of object into subject. Thus Hegel deals once for all\n  with both the dualist-monist and the rationalist-empiricist problems.\n  The abstractions of sense-perception are just as much abstractions as\n  those of conceptual thought; but in either form, the abstractions have\n  a content.(Source)\n\nSide-Note: While i understand reading Kant and important former german philosophers, i think its not really productive if you are interested in todays philosophy of mind. Kant/Hegel  use a very special and own terminology. Many english academic philsophers learned German, as translation of those texts is very tricky and not possible in 1:1 way. You really have to be aware in which ways philsophers at this time were biased, to understand their views, what philosophical movements competed at this time, what the historical context was. Also science is a social process according to Thomas Kuhn and cannot be analysed by pure logic, unfortunately :)\n"}]}

Design can come from undirected processes, which is the contention of Darwinian evolution.  Another example of an undirected process that produces a functional design would be a river bed.  Nobody tells the river where to flow, but the process of flowing haphazardly produces a path that efficiently moves water from high to low ground.  It is a design in a sense, but there is no intelligent designer.\nThe difficultly Plantinga addresses, however, is how one would produce a design for a truth-determining mechanism such as a mind.  It would seem that if the second and third criteria (a good original plan and modules aimed at truth) were denied, the final criterion (high likelihood of producing truth) would be denied as well.  And it seems unlikely that any unguided process would be a good plan for producing a functional mind or that modules would be directed at truth rather than, say, fitness in the evolutionary sense.\nBut an atheist could suggest following Plato that Mind exists as an abstract and that our minds imitate or mimic the form of Mind.  To put it in the terms above, the form of Mind is the original plan (and it is a good one) and the modules of minds aim at true because they mimic the modules of the form of Mind.  I see that type of thought in the works of Douglas Hofstadter, for instance.\nI'm not aware of any atheist thinker who does accept Plantinga's account of warrant, however.  It seems to have been designed to counter the idea that since we have the mechanism of evolution, we no longer need a theory of epistemology besides the assertion that evolutionary processes must result in better and better minds.  \n"}]}

They claim that there is not a plurality of concrete worlds, but of abstract objects, that do all the job of Modal Realism without commiting us to an, arguably weird, ontology. Ersatzism comes in different flavours. Lingustic Ersatzism for example thinks that an ersatz world is a maximal set of consistent sentences. Pictorial and Magical Ersatzism gets mentioned in chapter 3 aswell.\nIf you look for things outside Plurality, check out:\n\nRobert Stalnaker: Critical notice of D. Lewis, On the Plurality of Worlds. Mind (1988), 117-128.\nJohn Divers and Joseph Melia: The Analytic Limit of Genuine Modal Realism. Mind (2002), pp. 15-36.\nScott A. Shalkowski: The Ontological Ground of the Alethic Modality. The Philosophical Review (1994), pp. 669-688. (especially section 2)\n\nThese deal with Modal Realism, and why it might be a bad theory.\nFor alternative views beside ersatzism mentioned in Plurality itself, I just want to drop some names:\nThere is Modal Scepticism (Melia: Modality ch. 3), Modal Fictionalism (Rosen: Modal Fictionalism, and Modal Fictionalism Fixed) and Modal Reductionism (Sider: Reductive Theories of Modality, sections 1-3) among, probably, many other.\n"}]}

Instead, it is meant as a theory that explains, unifies, and performs other tasks for which theories are developed.  (As one other respondent as said, it attempts to take the talk of possible objects literally.)  The motivation for doing this is out of, for one thing, simplicity--which is a theoretical virtue.  The meanings of expressions would be very unambiguous, under Lewis's proposal.  In theories of modality that compete with modal realism, one always has to give a very complex and contentious story about what, exactly, they are suggesting modality is.  \nAnother reason that motivates modal realism is, as opposed to some other theories where abstract objects are given some kind of elevated ontological status, modal realism has a kind of \"ontological parsimony\" in that the only objects in the theory are physical objects.\nOne final thing is that you can, to some extent, see modal realism in a different light:  Think of it as making the point, \"Why should you believe that everything that exists is spatio-temporally connected?  That is a theory that comes bundled with a superfluous metaphysical commitment.  Modal realism is entirely consistent with relaxing that commitment.\"  Of course this doesn't get you to the conclusion that every conceptually possible, spatio-temporally disconnected region exists--but it does, perhaps, make it seem much less astonishing to suppose that they do.\nNow having enumerated some motivations for modal realism, you can perhaps see how people might argue against it:  You may attack the motivations.  Some argue that modal realism is not superior in its simplicity to some other competing modal theories, or they say that it is not sufficiently simple in comparison to make up for its theoretical vice of grounding all modal language in objects with which we have no contact.  Others would argue that it is not as ontologically sparse as it claims to be since, although it can handily do away with abstract objects as well as any theory can, it still proposes far more physical objects than are necessary.  \nIf a modal theory can retain the feature that only physical objects exist, be adequately simple, and still not excessively violate desired features of our language, then this would be a devastating blow to modal realism.  However, nobody has presented a theory which has convinced a large majority of philosophers that it has these features.  \nStill, the general consensus seems to be:  Yes, you may gain a lot of theoretical virtues by accepting modal realism.  But those theoretical virtues simply cannot adequately compensate for all the vice that comes with them.\n"}]}

Lewis claimed his overall theory was the best, unifying, systematic theory on the market. OPW was in many ways Lewis being honest about his theory's oddest consequence: Modal Realism.\nObjections to Lewis's proposal may take at least one of two forms:\n\nOne might object externally, with an incredulous stare, or more substantially, by developing a rival systematic theory that unifies explanations across domains as Lewis's does, but which doesn't entail Modal Realism.\nOne might object to Lewis's theory internally, say, by denying one or more commitments he makes that force acceptance of Modal Realism. In particular here, one might object to Lewis's requirement that in one's ultimate systematic theory, modal expressions must be reducible to non-modal expressions. Lewis seems to have inherited this 'extensionality' commitment from his teacher Quine. It works like this: expressions like \"It's possible John has hair\" are analyzed as 'There is some world such that a counterpart-John has hair'. In that other world inhabited by counterpart-John, the expression \"Counterpart-John has hair\" is true, and non-modal. If you've to compare the plausibility of remaining committed to extensionality vs commitment to Modal Realism, I have to say I'd prefer to drop the former to avoid the latter.\n\n"}]}

Before Gettier, there was a fair amount of consensus on knowledge: it was justified true belief (JTB). Plato said it. There were specific problems over induction and rationalism vs empiricism and so on, but to understand the basic question of \"what is knowledge?\", that's easy\u2014you believe something, that something is true, and your belief is justified (by some evidence or experience or whatever).\nIn the twentieth century, Edmund Gettier raised a problem with this: the Gettier problem. He showed a number of examples of situations where one satisfies the conditions given by the JTB account but cannot be said to have knowledge in any meaningful sense. (Russell also raised something like the Gettier problem in Problems of Philosophy, and suggested an interesting solution\u2014see the Wikipedia page for details.)\nResponses to the Gettier problem have drawn the lines of debate for current epistemology: between internalists and externalists, and between foundationalists and coherentists. All of these accounts try and add something to the justified true belief account. In the case of internalists, it is some kind of mental condition: to know that p you have to believe p; p has to be true; you have to be justified in believing p; and you have to be able to recognise by introspection of your conscious thoughts that you are justified. The internalists place the extra factor that makes justified true beliefs into knowledge within the mind. The externalists place it in the world.\nThere are a variety of forms of externalism: reliabilism is the most popular one. It says that you know something when you have a justified true belief arrived at through a reliable process. You will know that someone has scored a goal because the process of coming to learn that is a reliable one: if they had not scored the goal, you wouldn't end up having sensory perceptions of the goal being scored that induce justified beliefs. But if you are reading a newspaper that frequently prints propaganda or malicious lies, you would not have knowledge even if you have true beliefs because it is possible for the newspaper to not be telling the truth or only be telling the truth by accident. A perfect metaphor for reliabilism suggested by D.M. Armstrong in Belief, Truth, Knowledge is that of the thermometer. You know things when your beliefs change in response to the changing environment. The externalists run into interesting problems: without a mental property, one can end up saying that a computer or thermometer or database \"knows\" things.\nFor more information, check The Analysis of Knowledge on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\n"}]}

It is a paper I wrote for an epistemology class in 2005, entitled \"No Cogito\".  The entire content of the essay is fully copyright protected.  Also, some of the formatting was lost copying the text from Word to Markdown, so bare with me and pretend that anything in Latin that isn't in English is in italics.\n\nNo Cogito\n\nI.  Descartes' Mistake\n\nIn \u201cMeditations 1 & 2\u201d, Descartes attempts to reevaluate all of the beliefs that he intuitively holds to be true.  His purpose is to discern which beliefs are subject to doubt and which beliefs are necessarily true.  Descartes refers to the necessarily true beliefs as \u201ccertain\u201d (49).  Although the \u201cMeditations\u201d do not offer an explicit definition of certainty, Descartes does describe and imply the characteristics necessary for certainty.  For the purposes of this essay, the term certainty describes any proposition where there is no conceivable situation in which the proposition could be false.1\n\n\nDescartes particularly addresses two different classes of belief: a priori and a posteriori.  A priori beliefs include methods of reasoning and thoughts that are \u201clogically independent of experience\u201d2.  Descartes\u2019 assessment postulated that a priori beliefs were certain.  A posteriori beliefs require a basis on empirical perceptions.  They cannot exist independently of experience.  Descartes concludes that empirical beliefs are not certain, because he can conceive of situations in which his perception is mistaken by deception or confusion.  \n\nNow that I have presented a concise explanation of the basis for Descartes\u2019 reasoning, I can discuss the intended purpose for evaluating his argument.  Descartes famous Cogito states, \u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d.  This paper will contend that the assertion of the Cogito assumes more than is certain.  While a priori knowledge does seem to be capable of determining that there is thought, Descartes\u2019 appears to falter when he postulates the presence of a Self \u2013 the \u201cI\u201d.  This paper will not argue against the plausibility of the existence of Self or the intuitive belief that there is a Self, but instead will assert that the notion of Self does not possess Cartesian certainty.  In other words, there are conceivable and logically possible situations where there is no Self.  \n\n\n\nII.  The Intuitive Value of \"Self\"\n\n\nAlthough this essay argues against calling the existence of Self certain, it is only fair to investigate the reasons for believing that Self is beyond doubt.  It seems that people naturally believe in their own personal identity.  Therefore, intuition is the primary reason for believing that Self is certain.  It doesn\u2019t require much more than introspection and examination of language to determine that any person believes he is an individual.  In order to provide an accessible illustration of this intuition, I will personally demonstrate my own intuitive belief in myself.  At this moment, it seems to me that I am writing a paper.  I am also experiencing thoughts, emotions and sensations.  It appears clear to me that I am the one having these experiences and thinking these thoughts.  I even use the word \u201cI\u201d when I discuss things, which I believe are happening.  So, even though I am being skeptical about the certainty of Self I quite naturally believe that I have personal identity.  \n\n\nThere are two significant problems with an inference from an intuitive belief in Self to an assertion of the certainty of Self.  The first problem is that intuition does not prove anything more than a prima facie plausibility, and even if a possibility is plausible it does not follow that it is true.  For example, the belief that the earth was flat was quite plausible at one time.  People saw a flat ground and determined that the earth must be flat.  This is obviously not the case, however.  Furthermore, I will reiterate that I do not argue that the non-existence of Self is plausible, but possible.  The second problem with Descartes\u2019 reliance on intuition is that he has already indirectly disregarded the possibility of intuitions as certain.  The belief in \u201cI\u201d, like other intuitive beliefs, rely on empirical perceptions.  If I had never experienced the world, I would not be able to distinguish between thing that are internal and things that are external.  All things would be the same.  This correlates to the notion that our ancestors would not have believed in a flat earth if they had never seen a flat ground.  Therefore, the argument against the certainty of Self with respect to intuition is as follows.\n\n\nDescartes can be deceived about a posteriori beliefs.\nIf P is an intuitive belief, then P is an a posteriori belief.\nThe existence of Self is an intuitive belief.\nThe existence of Self is an a posteriori belief.  (2,3)\nDescartes can be deceived about the notion of Self. (1,4)\n\n\nFrom this, one can plainly see that the existence of Self is not certain.  My next step will be to offer examples in which the Self does not exist.  This counterexample will further clarify that the existence of Self is not certain.\n\n\nIII. Where the Existence of Self is False\n\n\nThe process of providing a conceivable situation in which there is no Self requires several steps.  I will begin by presenting a situation in which someone is confused about the nature of his own Self, and his Self will not in fact be his own.  I will then broaden this new notion of Self to a universal, and eventually will entirely abandon the notion of Self.  Once this is done, I will defend my counterexample against possible objections and it will thus be proven that the existence of Self is not certain.  \n\n\nTo begin I will talk about my friend, Charles.  Charles is a very confused and probably insane individual.  Charles believes that his foot can think.  Though he only has one mind, he unknowingly associates this mind with two different identities: his foot and himself (in the traditional way).  So as not to get confused, I will call the traditional mind of Charles by the name Chucky, and the foot-associated mind of Charles by the name Matilda.  Matilda has relatively simple thoughts.  Whenever Charles puts a sock on, Matilda believes that it is nighttime, and when Charles takes a shower Matilda believes it is raining and wonders why that body to which she is attached won\u2019t give her the Nike raincoat she likes.  Chucky is completely unaware of the thoughts that Matilda seems to be having.  Likewise, Matilda does not know that she is only an imaginary by-product of Charles\u2019s abnormal psychosis.  \n\n\nIn the case of Charles, Matilda believes that she is just like anyone else.  She believes that she is an individual and therefore has a Self.  However, it is obvious that Matilda is not an individual.  Matilda doesn\u2019t even exist.  The foot exists because it is a physical part of Charles.  The thoughts that Matilda seems to have exist as well, however they are not Matilda\u2019s but Charles\u2019s.  It would be ludicrous to think that Charles\u2019s foot is actually having thoughts.  Now, one of the beliefs that Matilda had was that she had a Self.  This is not the case, because something that does not exist cannot have an existent Self.  \n\n\nThe implication of the Charles example is that in the same way Matilda was mistaken about having a Self, Charles could be mistaken about having a Self.  Perhaps Charles doesn\u2019t really exist, but his thoughts result from the Godfrey\u2019s mental confusion in the same way that Matilda\u2019s thoughts resulted from Charles\u2019s mental confusion.  I would also like to point out that while I did choose to use a physical entity to associate with Matilda, it is not necessary.  I did this merely for simplicity and understanding.  Matilda could have just as easily not been associated with anything physical at all.  So, Descartes did not necessarily have to have a Self in the same way that Matilda did not have a Self, despite the instance of his thoughts.  The obvious argument against this contention is that there is still a Self.  It may not be of the same nature in which Descartes thought, but all of the confusion does end up being part of someone\u2019s confused Self.  Nevertheless, if Matilda were to evoke the Cogito argument it would fail, because by \u201cI think\u201d she would refer to Matilda, not Charles.  The next objection is that even if there are some instances in which the Cogito fails, there must be instances in which it succeeds.  While I do believe that even with this objection Self is no longer certain, I will strengthen my case by providing an example in which no Self exists.\n\n\nIt is clear that there is something that exists and I will agree with Descartes that this \u201csomething\u201d is thought.  The task is to conceive of a situation in which there can be a thought with no thinker.  I have already given an example in which a thought exists but is associated with a different Self than would be immediately obvious.  Let us examine the following conceivable example.  There are two people 3: Herman and Gertrude.  Herman and Gertrude are not acquainted with each other and might as well live in different continents.  The relation between Herman and Gertrude is that they share the same thought-wave sequence.  Thought waves work just like sound waves, except much faster.  They travel at a rate so fast that they can go from Asian Herman to South American Gertrude and back, without any realization of an instance in which he had no consciousness.  These waves are very similar to brain waves in the relationship with Herman and Gertrude, except that they are not limited to existing within one person.  Every thought that Herman has is really just a point on the waveform.  There is an association of the thought wave with Herman in the same way that thoughts associated with Matilda in the previous example, but it seems that Herman does not have an individual Self.  \n\n\nNow, imagine that these waves do not only comprise the minds of Herman and Gertrude but all of the minds in existence.  This would entail that each person\u2019s thoughts do not associate with a Self or personal identity, but actually are a miniscule part of one infinitely extensive waveform.  \u201cWhere would this wave come from?\u201d one might ask.  It might appear that it would still have to emerge from some massive Self, just like Matilda\u2019s thoughts emerged from Charles\u2019s Self.  However, it is conceivable that the wave existed without a Self.  On a smaller level imagine that a neurologist is able to determine the precise part of the brain that creates brainwaves.  He then extracts that piece of the brain from a person and supports its functionality by synthetic means.  Now, he has a brain that produces waves and exists independently of any person.  A piece of a brain that produces waves would not necessarily have and identity.  Even more clear, suppose that this brain\u2019s function is duplicated to a computer.  The waves result from something that has no chance whatsoever of being associated with a Self.  However these waves do exist.  Magnify this example and combine it with the example of the larger scale waveform.  What follows is a situation in which every thought of every person in existence is a point on a wave, which originates from a computer.  A computer here is something that does not associate with the notion of Self.\n\n\nThis example should prove beyond doubt that the existence of Self is not a certain concept.  I foresee the potential for this argument to be presented with two specific objections.  First, one might argue against the plausibility of this argument.  Suppose that a skeptical reader tells me that he can provide a parallel argument that is extremely implausible.  \u201cWhat if thoughts are really peanuts?\u201d the skeptical reader asks me.  \u201cWhat if every time I have a thought I am encountering a peanut?  Surely nothing about seeing a peanut implies self?\u201d  I have several things to say about such an example.  For starters, there is nothing that would make one think thoughts are peanuts.  However, there are real instances in which our perceptions are actually waves; for example, sound.  Secondly, I am not arguing for the plausibility of the argument I have presented.  My task was merely to prove that I could conceive of a situation in which the proposition that a Self necessarily exists is false.  I have done so.  And, while it might be extremely absurd to imagine that thoughts are peanuts and hence there is no Self, it is possible to conceive of it.  Therefore, such an opposition actually strengthens my argument by offering another counterexample to Descartes.  The second opposition that I foresaw was an argument against a necessary premise for my example, which states that the mind associates with something physical (i.e. brainwaves).  This argument does not hold much weight as can be seen when the proposed counterargument is more closely examined.  I argue that there is no Self in part because the mind is the brain.  The counterargument is that the mind is not the brain, because it is actually something else, which is related to a non-physical Self.  This unquestionably begs the question, and is therefore not valid.\n\n\nThe argument I have presented makes plain that the existence of Self is not certain by Cartesian standards.  Consequently, Descartes\u2019 Cogito has been refuted and can be reduced to the following.  There is thought, therefore thought exists.  This claim is much less interesting than the Cogito but much more concrete.  \n\nFootnotes:\n\n 1  \u201cThe proposition P is certain for S if and only if S cannot conceive of a situation in which it is false that P\u201d \u2013 Witmer, Gene.  \u201cThe First Meditation: A Close Look\u201d.

People experience themselves as persons. This experience is also of the person as the 'knower'. A 'knower' in the mind, same as the person, is ignored in bio sciences. Life is the source of knower-person in the mind. Mind is consciousness. Knower, person, consciousness and mind are not accepted as primary existential concepts in the sciences. In physics and in bio-sciences the primary focus is on a permanent world of objects outside the mind. This view is the legacy that Descartes gave to the sciences. Starting with the duality of mind and body, the primary nature of the material world which is of the nature of body, was formalized by Descartes. Still, this primary reality or truth is based on false logic. The world is secondary to the knower of the world. But in a democratic brotherhood of scientists, the right of the majority of persons to vote for primacy of matter cannot be denied.\nIn his 'meditations' Descartes stated that the brain, the body it is in, and the world of objects in which the bodies are, have all been created by God. That world exists independently of its knower and outside the mind. \u2018I think, therefore I am (COGITO ERGO SUM)\u2019 was his phrase that downgraded supreme truth \"I am\" below the thought process called mind which then could be shown to be dependent on the material world as the source of thoughts. Mind was with a knower \u201cI am\u201d in it. Descartes argued it was the first part of a dual reality; the mind and body. They both existed independently and yet, as a duality.   The thinking mind does not have a physical extension. The body has an extended presence but does not think. The \u2018I\u2019 is distinct from the body and has the ability to exist without the body. But, it can turn to the body by conscious choice. This is how Descartes argued to himself in his meditations to promote body to primacy to which conscious 'I' can turn. \nDescartes argued, it may be said that the mind has an existence no less valid than material existence. The mind is called mental phenomena. It is distinct from physical phenomena by quality of abstractness in place of the quality of materiality. The faculty of the mind which is the core of an individual person is located in consciousness. Or mind can be located within the body which is conscious. In the body the mind goes into brain of the body. When current day scientists say brain produces the mind they reduce the dualism of Descartes to monism of matter. \nRichard Dawkins wrote \u201ca dualist acknowledges a fundamental distinction between matter and mind. A monist, by contrast, believes that the mind is a manifestation of matter and cannot exist apart from matter. A dualist believes mind is some kind of disembodied spirit\u2026.. Like most scientists, I am not a dualist\u2026 I have learned to be an intellectual monist\u2026.The idea that there is a me,\u2026 is deeply ingrained in me and in every other human being, whatever our intellectual pretension to monism.\u201d (Dawkins, 2006)   \nInstead of material monism, if mind is created by Life, the mind consists of forms in consciousness. Body and other objects are forms in the mind with material quality. They are projected outside the mind and withdrawn, by life in every present moment. The material projections are withdrawn into abstract mental memory at the end of each present moment to make room outside the mind for the projection of the next moment. A new altered world of objects, is the projected in every next present moment, outside the mind. \nDescartes did not focus on the logical necessity of keeping the outside of the mind clear. Clearance is necessary so that, only the projected world of objects, of the present moment, exists outside the mind. The experience of all persons is only of the world of the present moment. An object is nothing but objectification of the form created in the mind with attribution of material quality to it. No one perceives past states of the world outside the mind. The past is withdrawn into memory for recall from memory. The knower \u201cI am\u201d in the mind, is the prime truth. The projected world appearing outside the mind in every present moment is secondary truth. This view corresponds as well to the duality formulated by Descartes. The logical necessity to withdraw the projection of every present moment into memory was a third truth which was overlooked by Descartes. \nMemory resides in the mind but is correlated to neurons of the brain. Only in the mind can the present moment and the past which is recalled from the memory co-exist. Outside the mind only the present moment exists. This fact is self evident to human beings. Still, the Cartesian illusion of a permanent world outside the mind persists as a logically impossible illusion in physics and in bio sciences. Further, the world is said to be a God created permanent world outside the mind wherein past and present of matter coexist simultaneously. This illogicality was highlighted by mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah.\nAccording to mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah , all physical models since Newton, including quantum mechanics, assume one basic premise. It is that the model enables prediction of the future from full knowledge of the present. Knowledge of the present and also of the past is necessary to predict the future. That requires that memory of the past of the universe comes into the present. For example, velocity of an object is said to be its property in its present state. But, to measure velocity the position of the object \u2018now\u2019 must be known and also its position a moment earlier. The knowledge must come from the past moment into the present moment. Otherwise velocity cannot be measured as distance over time. It is in the \u201cknower I am\u201d that the past and the present come together. Mathematics used in physics assumed that knowledge of the present suffices. But, retarded (or delay) differential equations would become necessary to bring data from the past into the present. If we do not have complete knowledge of the past, uncertainty would arise, otherwise. \nThe agency for an act, as the \u201cdoer I am\u201d in the \u201cknower I am\u201d is attributed to a human identity (called a rational agent in Economics). But an agency is not a concept of action in physics. Matter and energy act by themselves according to laws; they are entities altering or acting by themselves. Concept of agency would fall into psychology and not into natural sciences. Past comes into the present in the actions of inanimate objects studied in physics. Its models are based on an illusion \u2018of the past in the present\u2019 according to Atiyah. \n"}]}

However, most philosophers got the Cogito wrong. \nThere are two main ways philosophers got it wrong in their interpretation of the Cogito, usually to arrive at the irrelevant conclusion that it was not a valid argument. \nThe first way to get it wrong is indeed to take the Cogito as a logical argument! It is not. The Cogito is not meant for anyone to prove in a logical way the existence of their own mind to somebody else. Indeed, the fact that someone thinks is not apparent to anyone else. Someone saying \"I think, therefore I am\" merely shows to other people that this person speaks. This in itself could not possibly be a logical proof that the \"I\" of this person is thinking, let alone that it exists at all. Descartes himself didn't mean the Cogito to be used to assert to the rest of the world the existence of one's own mind.\nThe other way to get it wrong is to take the Cogito to be about the existence of the self. The self is this psychological phenomenon whereby a subject has a sense of their own biographical identity persisting over time, hopefully throughout life. Although Descartes' discussion of his notion of extreme doubt, leading to the Cogito, is suffused with the notion of self, the notion of self is irrelevant to the Cogito itself. \nThe Cogito doesn't say \"The self thinks, therefore the self exists\". This would be a valid argument but one whose premise couldn't be proved true. Instead, the Cogito is expressed in the first-person: I think. And Descartes took the time to explain carefully what was the subject, the \"I\". The I in the Cogito is the thinking thing. Not the self. Not Descartes. Not a person. Just the thinking thing. The thing doing the thinking. \nThus, the Cogito, if it was a simple logical argument, would be circular: The thinking thing thinks, therefore it exists. But it is not a simple logical argument.\nDescartes' Cogito is not a stand-alone metaphysical claim. It is part of Descartes' discussion about body and mind, and more generally Dualism.\nHe starts by justifying his notion of extreme doubt leading to his conclusion that he is able to doubt even the existence of his own body.\nThe Cogito, then, is the expression of his conclusion that he cannot similarly doubt the existence of his own mind, because doubting is indeed thinking and thinking implies the existence of the thinking thing, the \"I\" of the Cogito.\nSo, as part of this reasoning, the Cogito, rather than a logical argument proving the existence of human minds to the world, is the realisation that one cannot doubt, coherently, the existence of one's own mind.\nThe Cogito is often misunderstood, and indeed has been often misunderstood throughout history by many philosophers only too anxious to dismiss the Cogito as what they took to be an argument about the existence of the human soul.\nYou cannot prove the existence of your mind to other people. Whatever you do or say, someone else can reasonably and rationally doubt the existence of your mind. The Cogito doesn't solve this question and wasn't meant to solve this question. Yet, the Cogito is the perfect expression of the fact that no one can coherently doubt the existence of his own mind.\nThe Cogito is thus a very peculiar kind of argument, and Descartes himself tried to preclude the argument being understood as a logical inference. Something which also explains why the argument has often been misunderstood.\nThinking the Cogito is in effect a performative argument. Any mind thinking the Cogito formally proves its existence to itself. As such it is a fact. Rather than an ordinary argument, it is the expression of a self-demonstrative performance. \nI think whenever I perform the act of thinking. Thus, the premise \"I think\" becomes true, and can be made true, each time I perform the act of thinking. And this, in particular, whenever I think the Cogito itself. Each time I think the Cogito, the premise \"I think\" becomes true, and with it, the conclusion that I exist.\nBodies don't need to prove to themselves that they exist. If they do, so be it. If they don't, who cares?\nThe success of the Cogito, possibly the most well-known philosophical argument the world over, comes from its total unassailability in the face of the routine denial of the reality of minds. You can't prove the existence of your mind to somebody else. But whatever other people may say, the Cogito is the expression of the fact that you cannot coherently doubt the existence of your own mind. \nThis is all that the Cogito is about. The fact that we cannot coherently doubt the existence of our own mind. This is also the force of the Cogito. Nobody would need to pay any attention to Descartes merely asserting the existence of his own mind. Yet, each human being thinking the Cogito will be ipso facto incapable of doubting coherently the existence of their own mind. The mind understood as \"the thinking thing\".\n"}]}

In fact, there are philosophical arguments you'll find against them both. The basic idea that 'a thinking thing exists' comes to us via the Ancient Greeks but became widely known and was made popular by Descartes in his Meditations.\nIn this work he doubted everything he possibly could until he reached a base, the truth of which he could be absolutely certain. He thought it important to have a solid foundation to build his philosophical system on.\n\nArchimedes used to demand just one\n  firm and immovable point in order to\n  shift the entire earth; so I too can\n  hope for great things if I manage to\n  find just one thing, however slight,\n  that is certain and unshakable.\n\n(Unfortunately he very quickly lost his way and went from this solid foundation to a very questionable argument for the existence of God.)\nCogito ergo sum (\"I think therefore I am\") is the famous phrase from Descartes' Meditations. \"I think therefore I am\" is a stronger statement than \"A thinking thing exists\" so I have put the second forward for this answer.\nIt is in the class of truths that are self-evident. Thinking about it proves its truth. In philosophy we can't do physical experiments to disprove our theories so we need to rely on thought experiments instead. This is an example of a thought experiment. I can't conceive of any logically possible way of this being self-contradictory, i.e. false. By simply doing that thinking I have proved the proposition's truth.\n\nThe second class of provable things are the trivial truths of deductive logic. I'll divide this into two parts:\n\nThe Laws of Thought - axiomatic laws that we should agree on before we can start discussing philosophy.\nThe truths of propositional logic - these follow after we set up an axiomatic system.\n\nI'll cover these in turn, very briefly. I'll leave others to tear them down.\nThe Laws of Thought as a collection are attributed, like so much in philosophy, to Aristotle. They are:\n\nThe Law of Identity - an object is the same as itself - (A \u2261 A).\nThe Law of (Non)-Contradiction -  \"the same attribute cannot at the same time belong and not belong to the same subject and in the same respect\"1 - \u00ac(P \u2227 \u00acP).\nThe Law of the Excluded Middle - \"it will not be possible to be and not to be the same thing... there cannot be an intermediate between contradictories, but of one subject we must either affirm or deny any one predicate.\"2 - (P \u2228 \u00acP).\n\nThere are arguments against each of these.\nPropositional logic is a simple formal system. We define what is and isn't true via truth tables before we enter into discourse about it.\nA simple truth, by definition, in propositional logic is found in logical conjunction. Here's the truth table (from wikipedia):\n\nIf both of its operands (p, q) are true the conjunction of them (p \u2227 q) is also true.\n\n1Aristotle, Metaphysics. Aristotle claimed this as the most secure and unshakable of all principles.\n2Ibid.\n"}]}

If a statement, by the very interpretation\n  imposed upon it, is in principle incapable even of the most indirect sort of\n  intersubjective test, then though it may have meaning of a purely logical\n  sort, or may be significant in that it carries pictorial, emotional or\n  motivative appeals, or may even be testable in an exclusively subjective\n  manner, it cannot be accepted as an answer to a scientific question. The\n  phrase \"in principle intersubjectively confirmable or disconfirmable\" should\n  be understood in the most liberal manner. The sort of indirect testing of\n  assertions here allowed for includes of course the testing of only partially\n  interpreted postulate systems. It countenances as scientifically\n  meaningful, statements about the most remote, the most intricately\n  concealed or difficult to disentangle states of affairs. It includes\n  statements about unique and unrepeatable occurrences, if only they are of\n  a type that places them within the spatio-temporal-nomological net which\n  itself has an intersubjective confirmation base.

The precise meaning of\n  \"sufficiently highly confirmed,\" as well as the exact explication of \"degree \n  of confirmation,\" \"inductive probability,\" or \"evidential support\" need not be discussed in the present context.\n\nHis use of \"spatio-temporal-nomological net\" restricts our knowing to confirmation as our perceptions-of-world are anchored temporally to the here-and-now.

We can only create knowledge by finding mistakes in our current ideas and correcting them piecemeal. You notice a problem with your current ideas, propose solutions, criticise the solutions until only one is left and then find a new problem. We shouldn't say that a theory is false because it hasn't been proven because this applies to all theories. Rather, we should look at what problems it aims to solve and ask whether it solves them.

When something breaks causality, we feel pain, anguish, fear. Imagine you bash your head against the wall, but you don't feel nothing. Imagine you lose a loving one. Imagine you see an UFO or a miracle. All this events break the causality rules in our head and we lose the sense of reality.

Then, we can set a system plant, send the sunlight input (cause or action) and verify growth (reaction).

Would God accept it?  The reasonable response would be that a person recognizing both the value of Christian faith, and their inability to believe such a ludicrous idea, would pray fervently for Christian faith.  A merciful God would grant faith to anyone who seeks it, and the once-disbeliever would receive the infinite reward for finite effort anyways.  A lack of a merciful God would mean the unbeliever might (a) convince himself falsely to believe - finite loss, finite reward or loss depending on if you believe that believing is its own reward; or (b) waste a bunch of time praying and never come to believe, finite loss, finite loss or reward depending on if you believe that believing is its own punishment.\nYou can modify Pascal's wager to suggest a course of action for people coming from a different understanding of religion (e.g., non-Christian) than his:  A rational person would act according to whichever set of different religious traditions that promise infinite consequences and do not conflict with each other, weighted by which set he thinks is most likely to contain a religion that will actually deliver the hoped-for reward (which religions are most plausible), and also weighted by how attainable those rewards are for someone who takes this approach (e.g., can a person starting from unbelief end by attaining the rewards?).  I think it's a little more complicated than this, since you also have to weigh in punishments, but hopefully you get the idea.

Often the Wager is suggested as some sort of proof or last-ditch argument for God.  But since it was embedded in the Pens\u00e9es, which was Pascal's life project to defend Christian thought, it seems unlikely he intended for the Wager to stand alone.  Whether anyone would be convinced by such an argument seems not to be the main thrust of Pascal's formulation of the Wager.\nThe very introductory statement to his argument shows that Pascal concedes that God cannot be proven in the Aquinian sense:\n\nIf there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible, since, having neither parts nor limits, He has no affinity to us. We are then incapable of knowing either what He is or if He is. This being so, who will dare to undertake the decision of the question? Not we, who have no affinity to Him.\nWho then will blame Christians for not being able to give a reason for their belief, since they profess a religion for which they cannot give a reason? They declare, in expounding it to the world, that it is a foolishness, stultitiam; and then you complain that they do not prove it! If they proved it, they would not keep their word; it is in lacking proofs, that they are not lacking in sense.\n\nIt makes more sense to view Pascal's Wager as a precursor to Alvin Plantinga's Warranted Christian Belief.  In contradiction to Cartesian skepticism, we are free (even compelled) to act on beliefs that we cannot prove from first principles.  Any reasonable reading of Pens\u00e9es would conclude that Pascal is not trying to take the risk out of choosing the Christian faith.  Rather, he was defending the faith from the charge that it is irrational.\n\nThe Wager takes on added weight when you consider that Pascal himself made a bet and took up an ascetic lifestyle near the end of his life.  It was this time that the Wager was formulated and it was not published in his lifetime.  It's difficult to ignore the possibility that Pascal took the Wager quite seriously.  He summarized the argument by making this precise point:\n\nThe end of this discourse.\u2014Now, what harm will befall you in taking this side? You will be faithful, honest, humble, grateful, generous, a sincere friend, truthful. Certainly you will not have those poisonous pleasures, glory and luxury; but will you not have others? I will tell you that you will thereby gain in this life, and that, at each step you take on this road, you will see so great certainty of gain, so much nothingness in what you risk, that you will at last recognise that you have wagered for something certain and infinite, for which you have given nothing.\n\"Ah! This discourse transports me, charms me,\" etc.\nIf this discourse pleases you and seems impressive, know that it is made by a man who has knelt, both before and after it, in prayer to that Being, infinite and without parts, before whom he lays all he has, for you also to lay before Him all you have for your own good and for His glory, that so strength may be given to lowliness.\u2014Pens\u00e9e 233\n\nAnd I suppose that is the primary fallacy of Pascal's Wager: it can mean little to nothing to people who have not thrown themselves into the pattern of thought that Pascal himself followed.  It is unpersuasive since it builds on uncommonly held premises.\n\nOn a personal note, I find the Wager touching, even though or perhaps because, it is flawed.  I love T. S. Eliot description of Pascal: \"a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of the world.\"  A normal Christian considering the sacrifice he made would be content to contemplate the words of Jesus in Mark 8:34-38 (ESV):\n\nAnd calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, \u201cIf anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.

The so-called Professor's God, instead of rewarding belief for belief's sake, rewards rationality. If you think you have sufficiently strong reason to think that God exists as to justify rational belief, then rationally, you should believe that he does; if you think you don't have sufficiently strong reason to think that God exists as to justify rational belief, then rationally, you should withhold belief. And that's what the Professor's God wants from you: believe or not according to the reason you have, or don't have, to think that God exists. And as it turns out, the usual game-theoretical result of Pascal's wager--that you're better off believing than not believing--gets reversed, if you don't think you have sufficiently strong reason to think that God exists as to justify rational belief that he does. In that case, if you do believe you lose out, while you gain if you don't believe. But...what would an actual God be like? Would he want you to believe in him no matter what? Or would he want you to believe in him only if it were rational to believe in him? You don't know--so you also don't know which way Pascal's wager militates.\n(2) Pascal's wager is an expected-value argument. (And, I will note, it does not matter whether the probability of Pascal's God's existence is 0.5 or is 0.000000000000000000001; as long as it's nonzero, Pascal's wager goes through.) But we know that expected-value arguments involving infinitudes--game-theoretic arguments involving infinitudes--have serious problems with them, and relying on one seems highly dubious.\n(3) We know that the form of the argument isn't one that we would normally rely on. If I said that there were powerful aliens who would destroy the Earth in a week unless you said to yourself, and meant it, \"I submit to your [the aliens'] will.\" But suppose I further said that they would not only spare the Earth but would give you an elixir of immortality (and eternal youth and eternal good health--let's not forget the example of Tithonos) if you simply submitted yourself to their will (and they're telepathic, so they'll know). Nobody would do that unless he had really good reason to think that those aliens really existed! And nobody should rely on Pascal's wager unless he thinks he has really good reason to think that God exists already--which rather defeats the purpose of Pascal's wager in the first place.\n"}]}

This is important because one can hold that there's no ultimate proof against God's existence, and also hold that the probability that God exists is zero.  To do so, however, one must embrace the existence of infinite sets.  Thus Pascal thought that zero probability implied impossibility.  This fact about zero probability not implying impossibility is important to the Wager.  For if we hold a position with zero probability, the expected payout for belief isn't necessarily infinite.  Thus we could possibly have a finite expected payout for belief, but not be tied to an absolute proof against God's existence.\nMyself I hold such a position - that the probability for God's existence (at least certain types of Gods) is zero, but there's no absolute proof against these Gods existing.  It is also true that Richard Dawkins made the same mistake as Pascal in his \"Spectrum of Theistic Probabilities\".

The = marks a potentially broken symmetry.\nThe equal sign (=) was created by the 16th-century Welsh mathematician Robert Recorde. His rationale was that two parallel lines (=) were as ideally alike as two nonidentical things could be. Thus the equal sign bears a lost historical relationship to Euclid's fifth postulate. And this postulate proves famously paradoxical, because it introduces a negative infinity. How can we assume the two lines \"never ever\" meet? What keeps them apart? \nLikewise, how can we know the infinite nonidentity (=) of left-hand X and right-hand X? We can see them and perhaps categorize them into overlapping \"cell assemblies.\" But I do not see that this accounts for the idealization of the negative \"infinity\" of their \"equality.\" Here, the (=) symbol is a good example of what Hegel calls the \"identity of identity and difference.\" \nSorry, this is a bit of mental meandering inspired by this very interesting question.

Similarly, if we alter the experiment to be, instead of a person killed, a rat, or a watermelon, we'd find more people willing to throw the switch.  Or, we can keep it a person, but change the result to be one of an injury instead of death.  There are lots of ways we can rewrite the scenario to get different results.\nBut if that's what you're asking, what does neuroscience have to do with anything?  \nThe way you framed the question seems to imply that neuroscientists have something relevant to say on the matter, but this is at odds with the content of the question.\n"}]}

What is the real sense of \"freedom\" here, or in this oeuvre generally?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nietzsche has a tenuous relationship with free will. His theories here are fairly difficult, conceptually, to grasp, and I certainly won't claim that I have a thoroughly complete understanding of it. Also, it's worth bearing in mind that it isn't unheard of to find contradictions across Nietzsche's various works. Even putting aside the very late stage in his life where he becomes maniacal, his books were written at different times, and you can see his thought developing and becoming more refined in the later books, which occasionally contradicts sweeping claims that he made in the earlier books. That's in part why academic studies of Nietzschean philosophy generally center on a single text.\nBut as I understand it, the point he's trying to make in Beyond Good and Evil \u00a0is that there is really no such thing as free will. No one can ever be a truly free agent (i.e., no one can truly be sufficiently free to be morally responsible) because such would require that one be causa sui\u00a0 (or, the cause of oneself), and since we are not causa sui\u00a0, we cannot be free agents.\nThere are a couple of different ways that he goes about proving this in BGE, but they're fairly complex and not particularly relevant here. As a short summary, the first is that it's logically impossible to be causa sui\u00a0 (merely claiming that the very concept is \"fundamentally absurd\" and \"the best self-contradiction that has been conceived so far\"), and the second is that, based on his previously-developed notion of human agency, that we don't have sufficient control over our actions in order to claim that we acted out of free will. Or, in other words, that human beings are not self-caused in a sense that is sufficient to underwrite ascriptions or claims of moral responsibility.\nHe argues that both our moral and religious traditions (particularly Christianity, of which he holds a particularly bitter resentment) conspire to prevent us from ever truly having free will. In fact, he says that what we possess are causally determined wills. One of the aphorisms he uses to prove this asks the question, \"Does a Christian want to sin?\" Nietzsche disagrees, arguing that a true Christian can never truly want to sin, thus concluding that the Christian never truly has free will, as he was never free in the first place to do whatever he wished.\n\nHowever, in (primarily) Twilight of the Idols\u00a0 (and Genealogy of Morals), Nietzsche beings to develop a more positive, productive sense of free will, and more generally, freedom itself. He says that free will is not, in fact, characterized by the ability to do whatever you want, whenever you want, because if it were, it would be a meaningless concept. One who indulges their every whimsy is really just one who is a slave to her own impulses. Suffice it to say that Nietzsche doesn't think this is a particularly desirable state of affairs.\nInstead, he asserts that true free will is more accurately characterized by ambition and achievement. Really, he says, it's the ability to set a goal and act in such a way as to achieve it. This is also known in his works as the \"Will to Power\" (not to be confused with the corrupted form later espoused by his sister). Striving to reach the highest possible position in life is the ultimate goal of the will to power, and is in fact itself a manifestation of the will to power. In other terms, the will to power is just agency free will, as opposed to deserts-based free will. And he takes such agency free will to be a rare achievement, as opposed to the natural endowment that is deserts free will, the most commonly conceived form.\nExamined again in this light, it becomes apparent that the quote you've taken from TI \u00a0is really just a restatement or reprisal of the will to power:\n\nFreedom is the will to be responsible for ourselves. It is to preserve the distance which separates us from other men. To grow more indifferent to hardship, to severity, to privation, and even to life itself.\n\nTrue freedom, from a Nietzschean perspective, is really the will to affirm and to be responsible for oneself. It requires struggle against hardship and an acceptance of life's pain and suffering in a positive, life affirming way (amor fati\u00a0). But it explicitly does not \u00a0mean the denial of one's impulses and instincts. Indeed, it's the freedom from having to rely on them, but at the same time, the freedom from having to categorically reject them.\n(In summary: I think that the two quotes are really talking about two completely different things, although Nietzsche labels them both \"free will\". In fact, there are two entirely different notions of free will at play here, one of which Nietzsche harshly criticizes and the other, he exalts.)\n"}]}

We do not arrive at mathematical knowledge through sense observation. Nor do we rely on mere feelings. We have a power of intellectual intuition that gives us insight into the nature of numbers and their relations to each other, so that we can see the truth of basic mathematical principles.

If there were mathematically blind people who couldn't see why 2+2=4 or why any successor of a number is itself a number, then would this cast doubt on the objectivity of mathematics? Would it cast doubt on the intellectual intuition model of mathematical knowledge?\nI'm not at all sure that it would. Consequently, I'm not at all sure that morally blind psychopaths cast doubt on the objectivity of morality, or on moral intuitionism in particular.\nP.S.: One thing to bear in mind when researching this is that moral psychologists tend to talk about moral intuition as belonging to the affective and emotional side of human nature.

Psychopaths can be created as you mention, but they are most definitely also born that way. Those who became psychopaths due to perhaps a traumatic event or abuse in childhood I normally see referred to as the related term sociopath. When people speak of the super-rare 'curing' of psychopathy, I think it is this variety they are referring to.\nA true psychopath cannot be cured because it is not an illness. Their brains do not work the same way. They don't just lack empathy, they also do not understand metaphors or abstract words. They cannot appreciate art of music the way a normal person does. Their intuition is completely broken and they do not understand forethought. It is not just a part of their brain not working, they use their brains differently. They know they are different and they know what they are. I am kind of amazed that they can mimic us and pretend to be normal despite a complete lack of frontal lobe activity. Yet nobody is seriously researching it because like I said the field has psychopaths in it and they don't want it to be researched.\nThe problem of the psychopaths is in all likelihood a recessive genetic trait inherited from a hybrid ancestor of modern man.

As civilization came together land owners tended to marry land owners until we had kingdoms/countries. The top 1% (land and it's resources owners) of these kingdoms married within the top 1%, and their closest relatives and friends 4% married within the 4%. Think Kings and Queens 1%, and their inner courts 4%. Typically around 25-50 families (per geographical area) for hundreds to thousands of years (Egyptian Royalty) bred too closely. Such a small gene pool mating so closely for long periods speeds up adaptation to habitation (adapting to ones environment). Think of breeding cats or dogs that are closely related; which gives the offspring more of the attributes you are aiming for, but speeds up the domestication process (adaptation to habitation). This is part of a genetic survival mechanism. If a group of animals gets small and stays small this means that the environment has greatly changed, and their offspring must adapt as quickly as possible or go extinct. The idea for these individuals was to have a more educated, civilized/domesticated, and thoroughbred human, but messing with nature has it's consequences, and an imbalance was created. Imbalance = Evil and Balance = Good. In nature imbalances lead to greater imbalances; which lead to decay and death and/or death and decay. Balances lead to greater balances; which lead to growth and life. In psychological/sociological terms imbalance/division leads to greater imbalance/division; which leads to destruction and death and/or death and destruction. Balance/Unity leads to greater balance/unity; which leads to liberty and life and/or life and liberty. Hence, we ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, since now there was an imbalance in humanity emanating from the top of our societal structures; which lead to the need for \"the first shall be last and the last shall be first\". Once they were gods (pharos). Then they were descendants of gods (empors and empress). Next step down in this process they had \"devine rite\" as kings and queens. Now they are considered a personality disorder. Lets go back to adaptation to habitation, and we can see the attributes that were bred in and out. Example: Kings and Queens = 1 and Psychopaths = 2 as we compare. 1.Lives behind a wall, in a castle, and in a tower; 2. Low startle response and detached from others (antisocial in nature). 1. Everything they say goes without questioning and everything revolves around them; 2. Egotistical, thinks they are better, and thinks they are never wrong. 1. They live off of others; 2. Parasitical. 1. Have ultimate authority/power; 2. Seeks ultimate authority/power. 1. Must put their emotions aside to give orders to create/maintain order; 2. Shallow emotions. 1. The weight of the power/responsibility and being a symbol/ideal always crushes in the end leading to a resentment of responsibility and those who they are responsible for (too much responsibility) . 2. Dosen't take responsibility for their actions and has a \"me against the world\" mindset. Etc... I think you're getting the picture. For a moment I would like to return to what many people think of as antiquated terms, Good/balance and Evil/imbalance. There are individuals who are more \"feelers\" and individuals who are more \"thinkers\", so we need words that resonate with both. When you hear the word \"Good\" you think about good/positive thoughts and/or feel good/positive feelings. When you hear the word \"Evil\" you think about bad/negative thoughts and/or feel bad/negative feelings. Our lack of understanding of these terms lead to individuals misinterpreting their true meaning. To finally answer the question posed; \"Does the existence of psychopaths pose a problem for moral realist who argue we have a moral intuition?\", the answer is no. Darwin himself stated; Conscience, is by far the most important\u2026 of all the differences between man and the lower animals\u201d.\nConscience = Moral Intuition.\nThere is another 17-18% of the general population who have what's referred to as \"dark empathy\"; which is \"Cognative Empathy\" that is used to benefit themselves without seeing how it can affect others,  and many times not caring how it affects others when they can see. Psychopathy factor-1 and 2 = 5% of the general population and have an average of 3-4 children in which they directly affect and influence the lives of. 3-4 multiplied by 5% = 15-20% or an average of 17-18%. The 17-18% acquired their \"dark empathy\" and learned to use it a certain way from a parent or parents with Psychopathy.\n"}]}

Thus to a part of your question, it isn't tolerance of intolerance that kills tolerance, but intolerance itself that cannot allow tolerance to exist in it's purest form within a society.\nAs to arguments for and against intolerance, such would be made based on a society's moral frame of reference.  If a society tolerates slavery, it might be able to argue that such slavery is for the greater good of the society in question. Those opposed within such a society might not be able to justify their own individual intolerance towards slavery if they cannot make a compelling argument that fits within the society's moral point of reference in order to show the society itself that intolerance of the tolerable may be necessary.\nPersonally, I am glad we have an intolerant society, in that it allows those of us who feel more tolerant towards others to have the freedom to do so, knowing that someone else's intolerance has protected my own right to be tolerant! ;-)\n"}]}

It's not really even a social contract in that sense, as there is no agreement.\nThis is the fundamental idea behind David Gauthier's criticism of Rawls.

I think that no rational person would enter into a 'contract' that they cannot leave and about which they are uncertain of others' actions. Again, it's not really a social contract at all.

In particular, Nozick's seminal work entitled Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974). It's written as an almost direct critique of Rawls's Theory of Justice, published a few years prior in 1971. In it, Nozick adopts a libertarian approach to justice to challenge Rawls's Second Principle of Justice.\nAmong other things, Nozick's most easily understandable argument boils down to the point that property rights must be included within Rawls's notion of individual rights; that is, the individualist right of and to self-ownership. But once we include that right, we arrive at a subtle contradiction. In order for Rawls's theory to make sense, he must reject the conception of absolute property rights; but at the same time, at least in Nozick's view, the absolute right to property is one of the individual rights that must be protected.\nBut personally, I'd say the best attacks against Rawls are those that fundamentally question the notion of social justice at its core, i.e., F. A. Hayek. As a member of the Austrian School, Hayek is probably most famous for his work on economics. But mixed in with the economics is a lot of fascinating treatment of social and institutional justice. His aptly-named book, The Mirage of Social Justice, is probably the best place to start researching such a critique. A few gems (emphasis added):\n\nThough we are in this case less ready to admit it, our complaints about the outcome of the market as unjust do not really assert that somebody has been unjust; and there is no answer to the question of who has been unjust. Society has simply become the new deity to which we complain and clamour for redress if it does not fulfil [sic] the expectations it has created. There is no individual and no cooperating group of people against which the sufferer would have a just complaint, and there are no conceivable rules of just individual conduct which would at the same time secure a functioning order and prevent such disappointments.\nThe only blame implicit in those complaints is that we tolerate a system in which each is allowed to choose his occupation and therefore nobody can have the power and the duty to see that the results correspond to our wishes. For in such a system in which each is allowed to use his knowledge for his own purposes the concept of 'social justice' is necessarily empty and meaningless, because in it nobody's will can determine the relative incomes of the different people, or prevent that they be partly dependent on accident. 'Social justice' can be given a meaning only in a directed or 'command' economy (such as an army) in which the individuals are ordered what to do; and any particular conception of 'social justice' could be realized only in such a centrally directed system. It presupposes that people are guided by specific directions and not by rules of just individual conduct. Indeed, no system of rules of just individual conduct, and therefore no free action of the individuals, could produce results satisfying any principle of distributive justice.\nWe are of course not wrong in perceiving that the effects of the processes of a free society on the fates of the different individuals are not distributed according to some recognizable principle of justice. Where we go wrong is in concluding from this that they are unjust and that somebody is to be blamed for this. In a free society in which the position of the different individuals and groups is not the result of anybody's design\u2014or could, within such a society, be altered in accordance with a generally applicable principle\u2014the differences in reward simply cannot meaningfully be described as just or unjust. There are, no doubt many kinds of individual action which are aimed at affecting particular remunerations and which might be called just or unjust. But there are no principles of individual conduct which would produce a pattern of distribution which as such could be called just, and therefore also no possibility for the individual to know what he would have to do to secure a just remuneration of his fellows.\n[...]\nThe conduct of the individuals in that process may well be just or unjust; but since their wholly just actions will have consequences for others which were neither intended nor foreseen, these effects do not thereby become just or unjust. (p. 69\u201370)\n\nAnd that's only a small tip of the iceberg; it's really great stuff. Of course, he's writing from the perspective of an economist, discussing the market system and its external effects, but that's still applicable to Rawlsian theory on a number of levels.\nAdditionally, he sharply criticizes the notion of distributive justice on the basis of reallocation. He denounces any attempt by government to redistribute capital or income on the basis of individual need as an unacceptable intrusion upon individual freedom (bringing in shades of Nozick's critique, which accuses distributive justice of being in contradiction with Rawls's own expansive theory of individual rights).\nIf you're not much of the book type, here's a YouTube video that I just turned up in a Google search, showing James Buchanan and Hayek discussing where Rawls went wrong in his conception of social justice. But I must warn: There are probably better videos, and I don't have sound where I am, so I can't screen it.\nFinally, if critical theory is your bent, you can find some good material from feminist authors to use as a critique of Rawls. Martha Nussbaum and Iris Marion Young (one of my personal favorites) are probably the most well-known here.\n\nAs far as a good contemporary of Rawls, you might look no further than Rawls himself! He has written several books following ATOJ\u00a0 that aim to respond to some of his critics' writing in the interim (Nozick in particular).\nAnd I would strongly suggest reading the works of Thomas Nagel. He actually argues that Rawls's theory of justice doesn't go nearly far enough, as it merely seeks to redress the inequalities, rather than remove them altogether. He laments that a Rawlsian state would still permit intolerable inequalities and that we need to adopt an even more ambitious view of equality.

He is well aware that people are not created equal. However, what he does believe is that every individual should be taken to have equal moral status i.e. our considerations of justice shouldn't start from the starting point of preferential treatment towards some. (I would imagine - or hope! - that very few would disagree with this as a fundamental part of the definition of 'justice'.)\nSo, we're trying to work out fair principles that treat everyone as morally equally important, but these principles are to govern over a situation where people are not equal in strength, mental ability, inherited wealth, social connections, and so on. Now, if we actual people were to try to design these principles then it seems likely that, say, on the whole the weakest or poorest might try to design principles that put their interests above all others, whereas the wealthiest and most powerful might try to design principles that maintain their status. The naturally physically strongest might try to design principles that link power to physical aptitude. And so on - and this doesn't seem fair, or workable.\nSo, how can we avoid this situation? Rawls thinks that we can avoid it by undertaking a thought experiment: if none of us actually knew anything about our social status, strengths/weaknesses, race, gender, etc., but knew that we were about to enter into a society that we were going to have to be happy in, what principles would we choose?\nWhat is actually going on here is that the method, in the thought experiment, of depriving the deliberating parties of information is a way of building in fairness and impartiality into the deliberation. The parties can't possibly be *un*fair to one another in their choice of principles because they wouldn't know how, and wouldn't know whether their choices would actually disadvantage themselves. As such, whatever principles these imaginary parties would choose will be fair and impartial.\nNow, we could argue about exactly what principles the parties behind the veil would actually choose, but, at any rate, the above is the method and whatever else we might say one can understand the thinking behind it and appreciate the philosophical elegance. I think it would be a mistake to suggest that it relies on the idea that people could be 'exchanged'; firstly, it is just a thought experiment designed to generate certain kinds of conclusions in the right way, and so doesn't really have a lot to do with actual people, and secondly, its aim is to arrive at principles that can ensure the just social co-existence of people who, indeed, aren't interchangeable.\n\nSecondly, using the veil to argue for distributive justice and\n  egalitarianism, as Rawls does, in my opinion seems to presume that\n  moral virtue is orthogonal to societal position, so that it is only\n  \"fair\" that we \"start off on the same foot\"; I don't agree with that\n  either, because I think the poor, at least in America, are somewhat\n  less virtuous than middle America or the rich, and that a moral\n  accounting behind this veil would in any case send these lacking to\n  the same positions they occupy.\n\nI think I read above that this isn't a forum for opinion so I'll move swiftly on from that one (!...) but I think again Rawls's answer would centre around the idea of the equal moral status of persons (at least at birth). Clearly, many would argue that during life people through their agency makes choices that mean that they 'deserve' or 'don't deserve' certain things, but Rawls thinks that in the eyes of justice every person is still equal; no matter how 'good' or 'bad', people don't earn preferential treatment from justice (we wouldn't say that someone who gives to charity should get away with murder, or that people who are mean to their friends should be stripped of their wealth). Rawls isn't really interested in what people 'deserve' through their deeds (for that you want Robert Nozick) or through some idea of their innate virtue, but rather in having a social system that isn't predestined to militate against the life chances of particular people and groups.\n\nBut, alas, I'm a naif in philosophy, having never studied it\n  seriously. So I have two questions: Are there any prominent attacks on\n  Rawls' position along these lines, and secondly, if so, have any\n  liberal philosophers updated Rawls' argument to deal with positions\n  from hereditariainism and so on?\n\nOn your first complaint, that people are different and not exchangeable, there is a well-known critique of Rawls - and perhaps of liberalism and the social contract more generally - that it assumes that all people are essentially equal and the same, when in fact they are not, as is proved by the ubiquitous fact of need and dependence in society. It is unclear that, say, the mentally handicapped or the very old and frail, or young children, can participate in the (hypothetical) social contract that Rawls envisages, and so - the critique goes - Rawls cannot deal with difference and dependence and need. This argument is particularly associated with feminist critics like Martha Nussbaum or Eva Kittay. I've not explained it particularly well but it is easy to look up and is often called the 'dependence critique' of Rawls. Handily for your second question, both Nussbaum and Kittay are still essentially within the liberal tradition and aim to adapt rather than to overhaul Rawlsian liberal egalitarianism.\nOn your second complaint, that the idea of 'starting off on the same foot' is misguided because virtue tends to increase up the income distribution (at least in the US), it sounds like Robert Nozick would be about the closest to what you have in mind. I doubt that he would express it in terms of the 'virtue' of different social groups, but he too doesn't like the idea of starting off on the same foot because he is interested in property and what it means to hold property justly, and for him as long as property was acquired justly in the first place and has been passed on fairly - such as through a family - then it is still held justly. As a result, his conclusions are essentially very right-wing in advocating almost no redistribution or interference in the market (although not quite as right-wing as suggesting that the poor are less virtuous than the middle class and wealthy and even given the chance would still go sliding back down to a lowly and un-virtuous position...)\n"}]}

A person is capable of changing his mind on a timescale of the order of seconds. Genes change only on timescales of the order of decades. Furthermore, genes are always selected according to whether they can produce a working body. Ideas can go through stages in which they need not be implemented in practice, which allows the generation of explanatory knowledge with no immediate application. As such, the knowledge that makes you different from other people is all in your ideas, not in your genes. Even in cases where that knowledge happens to match what is in your genes that has something do to with the logic of the problems involved.\nThe idea of distributive justice is piffle. It is not the case that stuff gets produced and then can be distributed any way some tinpot tyrant deems fitting. The only way to make stuff worth distributing is to offer goods for sale on the market and let people decide whether to voluntarily buy them.

Taking stuff without the owner's consent and handing it out to people who are deemed deserving for whatever reason sabotages this process.\nAs for whether the poor are bad people.

Does it have to be possible for mating to occur naturally in the wild, or is it enough if it's only possible with human intervention? In this context Daniel Dennett, in Darwin's Dangerous Idea talks about chihuahuas and Great Danes, as mentioned above. Both counted as of the same species but clearly in the wild interbreeding is unlikely to say the least and even with human assistance might not be possible.  Another aspect of the problem is that we think speciation mainly occurs as a result of reproductive isolation - but that too is a matter of degree. Populations can be more or less isolated (both geographically and in terms of mate choice.) A type of Sorites phenomnon seems to arise but seeing it as a problem seems to me to result from the failure to fully take on board the fact that speciation is not an event but a historical process. We represent it with a branching pattern but if you think about actual branches on real trees where exactly would you say you no longer have one branch, but two? There is no precise point. We're able to say clearly this part is one branch, and these parts are two, but there's a vague area in between where any drawing of the line would be arbitrary. While in that vague area for populations of organisms that a relatively reproductively isolated, there is no definitive answer to the question as to whether we still have one species or now have two. And so as a result the boundaries between species are similarly fuzzy. That is not in itself a criticism - it may just be that many concepts in biology are fuzzy, and so be it.\n"}]}

The point is that reason will never reach out into the world - the passions are what we get when the world reaches into us. And therefore, reason will never be able to control them or understand them because they (the passions/sensations/impressions) are the raw materials of reason. So here are some ways to understand this general tendency, as expressed in the famous maxim you quote:\n\nEmotivism in Ethics: Reason cannot enter into our ethical judgements because these judgements are based on sentiments (i.e. passions.) An act of cruelty will cause in us a feeling of injustice, and that feeling (sentiment/passion) will be the reason why we pass an unfavourable judgement on an act of cruelty. This is the polar opposite of a Kantian view of ethical judgements to which one arrives at by pure a priori reasoning.\nTaste in Aesthetics: Here the situation is more complicated. Hume admits that beauty can only ever be as it were 'in the eye of the beholder' because beauty cannot be in the object but must be wholly contained in the pleasurable sentiment it causes us. Indeed Hume explicitly states that pleasure is the essence of beauty (we define as beautiful that which gives us pleasurable sensations.) So here you see that reason will always be a slave of the passions, i.e. you will never be able to rationally convince your friend who thinks artworks by Dali are ugly that they are, in fact, beautiful. Nevertheless in On the Standard of Taste Hume tries to argue that there are in fact some objective aesthetic standards, by urging us to heed the advice of ideal critics which he goes on to define (i.e. critics possessed of a delicacy of taste, and sound understanding, sharpened by practice and comparison and who are free from prejudice.)\nSelf and Causation: Hume also famously argued that there is no such thing as direct causation, only observable regularities; and that there is no indestructible self, only impressions which we call our own. If you take passions to include sensations of hot or cold or sense impressions, then you can interpret the maxim that reason will always be a slave to such passions as a further advocacy of this type of empiricism or anti-realism. The latter (anti-realism) in the sense that there are no shared constraints that ever effectively decide such questions as 'Am I here?' or 'Is this colder than this?'\n\n"}]}

(T 2.3.3 p. 415)\n\nThe context is his discussion of what is sometimes called \"moral psychology\", the study of how we are motivated to act morally. In particular, he raises a question about the role of practical reason in moral motivation. Hume vehemently opposes the view, held by philosophers before him (and after him), that to act morally is have a rational grasp of moral truths. He defends an instrumental conception of practical reason, according to which the role of reason is only to find out which means helps achieve a given goal. Reason (or the intellect) plays no part in determining the goals. Our goals are set exclusively by what Hume calls the passions and what today is most often called desires. Desires cannot be evaluated as true or false or as reasonable or unreasonable - they are \"original existences\" in our mind and arise from unknown natural causes. We cannot be criticized rationally for our desires (As Hume remarks, it is \"not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger\" (p 416)).\nReason is the slave of the passions in the sense that practical reason alone cannot give rise to moral motivation; it is altogether dependent on pre-existing desires that furnish motivational force.

There is no such thing as an unemotional or purely rational decision, because to decide, by its nature, is to have a preference for, i.e. an inclination toward or aversion to, something.\nReason's (i.e., cognition's) role is to structure the world for us: it lays out a schematic of how objects and ideas are connected. But this is merely cold information, devoid of any significance on its own. Rational categories have no value or priority without feeling.\nThe passions (i.e., emotions or affects) are necessary to evaluate any object or idea as valuable, problematic, virtuous, immoral, good, or bad, because these forms of evaluation are all based on either a positive or negative impression. Decisionmaking is neither an rational nor \"irrational\" (whatever the hell that means) process: it is based on preferences, which must arise from emotional states and can never just magically be produced by reason alone.\nWhat reason does is enable things to become positive or negative by association. I have a goal that I care about, and reason suggests to me that a previously unimportant object will help me achieve it. Thus the object itself becomes important to me. Reason creates the association--it's a telescope that allows me to see the distant or indirect emotional consequences of the object--but the emotion itself remains my only motive and only decider.\n"}]}

(of course trough this function reason can set instrumental goals, like telling us that we should not jump from the bridge if we want to live, but in the end it is still the desire to live which keeps us from jumping (or not, if we want to die)).\ncontrary to what some said here: this has nothing to do with empiricism, which only concerns the kind of sources that beliefs can be founded on.\n"}]}

For almost all philosophers believe in something akin to the so called 'golden rule of ethics' (the form most germane here being: \"All moral acts remain moral if committed by everyone\"), and almost all that practise philosophy do so for some ethical consideration. The syllogism that ends, therefore, in almost all philosophers prescribing philosophy on ethical grounds is a moment's work to complete.\nBut now, how to skirt the guillotine and leap from is to ought? Perhaps one could avoid such considerations of ought altogether, observing that all people introspect\n\n...and it is the work of Socrates & co to help them do what they seek to do already more fruitfully.\nThis feels a little unsatisfying, though: somewhat straw-mannish to claim there is nothing qualitatively different in the self-examinations of the Athenians and those of Socrates. At the risk of incorrectness, then: Mr. Hume- to the scaffold!\nBuilding on the original dummy question (\"Why would...\"), I would like to reach for my meta-ethical breeze-block of choice, in R.M. Hare's universal prescriptivism, which ascribes the origin of moral injunctions as non-directed imperatives that emerge from a society (\"Don't kill!\"). In this framework, the morality of prescribing introspection is identical with the morality of introspection itself, which in turn stems (as articulated by the OP) from the imperative that as moral beings we must grapple with reality- something we would fail to do without introspection.\nAgain, though, (although my use of Hare is based purely on my thinking he happens to be right) I suspect people will think I'm cheating here. So perhaps, to be as general as possible, let's talk the social contracts.\nIn the end, it is a truism that groups with common goals and common values achieve those goals and actuate those values with greater efficacy than the leading brand. The impulse to spread a cultural more that is beneficial (or at least impossible to get rid of- once you introspect, aside from alcohol or a coathanger up your nostril, there's no going back!), is one that leads to a more cohesive, more productive society, more capable of modelling a universal in-group. \nThere is selfishness there too, certainly: If I never saw another TV talent show again, I would be a happier man. But, impractical (though possibly correct) calculations of the relative happiness of Socrates and pigs aside, the moral heart that drives evangelism of the examined life is, in one way or other, the picture of humanity as a shared endeavor that only introspective thought can show in its fullness.\n"}]}

It's kind of a recurring joke among those who are familiar with his work. For example, the phrase \"God is dead\" is often taken completely out of context and used to justify things that Nietzsche himself never intended.\nIn this specific example, Nietzsche is not at all \u00a0endorsing the statement that that which does not kill you actually makes you stronger. That's only one part of the aphorism, not the entire thing. And the collective resonance of the phrases is really what makes the aphorism:\n\nOut of life's school of war: What does not destroy me makes me stronger.\n(Aus der Kriegsschule des Lebens: Was mich nicht umbringt, mach mich st\u00e4rker.)\n\nThe above-quoted line comes from a list of aphorisms in Twilight of the Idols\u00a0 that Nietzsche has labeled \"Maxims and Arrows\". In this section, he reflects on a series of statements that people commonly believe, but are either obviously fallacious or turn out to be true only in a surprising and unusual way. The name \"arrow\" reflects his hope that his analysis will pierce through people's typical complacency.\nHe's really making fun of the statement. And in typical Nietzschean style, he attempts to refute it using snarky, obscure jabs rather than nuanced or rigorous analytical analysis. He evokes images of hardships that are almost nearly fatal, from the physical to the emotional, to show how ludicrous it is to claim that repeatedly adversity could ever be a source of strength. In fact, people who are repeatedly confronted with such hardships tend to become depressed, unproductive, and even suicidal.\nIn pointing out its ironic falsity, Nietzsche also makes the point that the statement is quite useful for controlling others: convincing them to be strong and push through difficult situations, cajoling them into giving up their own lives for the larger cause of their country (\"the military school of life\"), etc.\nIn fact, Nietzsche very much despised the statist notion of warfare, as is clearly evidenced in this excerpt from \"The Wanderer and His Shadow\" (the third section of Human, All Too Human, 1878):\n\nThe means to real peace. No government admits any more that it keeps an army to satisfy occasionally the desire for conquest. Rather the army is supposed to serve for defense, and one invokes the morality that approves of self-defense. But this implies one\u2019s own morality and the neighbor\u2019s immorality; for the neighbor must be thought of as eager to attack and conquer if our state must think of means of self-defense. Moreover, the reasons we give for requiring an army imply that our neighbor, who denies the desire for conquest just as much as does our own state, and who, for his part, also keeps an army only for reasons of self-defense, is a hypocrite and a cunning criminal who would like nothing better than to overpower a harmless and awkward victim without any fight. Thus all states are now ranged against each other: they presuppose their neighbor\u2019s bad disposition and their own good disposition. This presupposition, however, is inhumane, as bad as war and worse. At bottom, indeed, it is itself the challenge and the cause of wars, because, as I have said, it attributes immorality to the neighbor and thus provokes a hostile disposition and act. We must abjure the doctrine of the army as a means of self-defense just as completely as the desire for conquests.\nAnd perhaps the great day will come when people, distinguished by wars and victories and by the highest development of a military order and intelligence, and accustomed to make the heaviest sacrifices for these things, will exclaim of its own free will, \u201cWe break the sword,\u201d and will smash its entire military establishment down to its lowest foundations. Rendering oneself unarmed when one had been the best-armed, out of a height of feeling\u2014that is the means to real peace, which must always rest on a peace of mind; whereas the so-called armed peace, as it now exists in all countries, is the absence of peace of mind. One trusts neither oneself nor one\u2019s neighbor and, half from hatred, half from fear, does not lay down arms. Rather perish than hate and fear, and twice rather perish than make oneself hated and feared\u2013-this must someday become the highest maxim for every single commonwealth.\n\nIronically, just as Nietzsche had observed elsewhere (and as some readings of the work might claim, was attempting to demonstrate through the \"Maxims and Arrows\" section), writers are remembered primarily for and by such simple aphorisms. The well-known American rapper, Kanye West, even includes a paraphrase in his hit song Stronger \u00a0(again, requoted without the phrase that prefaces it):\n\nTh-th-that that don't kill me\nCan only make me stronger\n\nSurely this apparent demotion of Nietzsche to \"idle talk\" would only incense Heidegger, but Nietzsche appears to have grown content with this state of affairs some time later, following his initial rant against modern media systems in Human, All Too Human.\n"}]}

That which has learned to bend, is stronger than that which has not.\nNietzsche was all about pain, torture and misery, because that is what would make the right people stronger, and thus weakness could be overcomed, and people could be able to bear other nations, and people in general, in their hearts, and people would then rather die than live in a state of hate and fear, and thus common rationality could be brought back as the domineering instinct in peoples, instead of rabid pain giving expression to mutual self-destruction.\nThus, he very much meant that people grow stronger by the things which makes them bend without destroying (killing) them, like the sturdy plants which has been exposed to hard but fitting wind.\nNietzsche was certainly not a pacifist by any means, but only one who saw that true happiness and peace can only come by by the means of an overfullness and strength to lay down arms, to laugh at murderer of you, if you cannot conquer him, out of  super-rationality, embodied in Supermen.\n\"Haha, you cannot kill me, because I live on - even beyond you!

The muscle that has never been to war, in some metaphorical sense, and come out alive is weak, whereas that which has done so is strong.

But regardless of which he uses (the hammer or tuning fork) there is no denying that the one solitary aphorism he uses in the Preface, which he unquestionably states as his own motto, is very similar in meaning to \"What does not destroy me makes me stronger.\"\nAs for war, it should be noted that while Nietzsche was no fan of physical war, he also stated quite clearly before the maxim in question: \"Out of life's school of war...\". Is one to believe he actually meant government-to-government acts of violent warfare? Or by saying \"life's school of war\" is he actually referring to the war of competing philosophies, the war of humanity's need for idols, and/or one's war within themselves?\nHe further explains in the Preface:\n\nThis essay \u2014 the title betrays it \u2014 is above all a recreation, a spot of\nsunshine, a leap sideways into the idleness of a psychologist. Perhaps a new war, too?\nAnd are new idols sounded out? This little essay is a great declaration of war; and\nregarding the sounding out of idols, this time they are not just idols of the age, but\neternal idols, which are here touched with a hammer as with a tuning fork\n\nSo it can be easily seen that he does use the concept of war outside its physical gov-to-gov meaning, and therefore it would be reckless to suggest that his maxim on strength is referring merely to soldiers fighting for a commander and/or being controlled by others.\nBut above all, at his core Nietzsche believed in the virtue of struggle and hardship to attain intrinsic happiness. The fact that he lists this idea in Maxims and Arrows does not mean he simply wants to ridicule the concept, instead he is doing unto his own beliefs what he is doing to all other listed \"idols\": questioning the validity of ideas to see if they hold truth.\nAt the end of the Twilight of the Idols he closes with the following paragraph which pretty much sums up his whole thoughts on \"what does not destroy me makes me stronger\". It\u2019s pretty unambiguous especially after spending much of the essay questioning the suffering=strength concept, as he concludes its validity by stating how he is very much in favor of this maxim:\n\nThe psychology of the orgiastic as an overflowing feeling of life and\nstrength, where even pain still has the effect of a stimulus, gave me the key to the\nconcept of tragic feeling, which had been misunderstood both by Aristotle and even\nmore by modern pessimists. Tragedy is so far from being a proof of the pessimism (in\nSchopenhauer's sense) of the Greeks that it may, on the contrary, be considered a\ndecisive rebuttal and counterexample. Saying Yes to life even in its strangest and\nmost painful episodes, the will to life rejoicing in its own inexhaustible vitality even\nas it witnesses the destruction of its greatest heros \u2014 that is what I called Dionysian,\nthat is what I guessed to be the bridge to the psychology of the tragic poet. Not in\norder to be liberated from terror and pity, not in order to purge oneself of a dangerous\naffect by its vehement discharge \u2014 which is how Aristotle understood tragedy \u2014 but\nin order to celebrate oneself the eternal joy of becoming, beyond all terror and pity \u2014\nthat tragic joy included even joy in destruction.\n\n"}]}

Popper's falsifiability clearly discusses a way to define the nature of a fact, rather than the reduction of any logical argument.\nWe can claim that logical arguments that are non-falsafiable are non-scientific from an objective perspective:\n\nThese factors [Marxism, astrology] combined to make Popper take falsifiability as his criterion for demarcating science from non-science: if a theory is incompatible with possible empirical observations it is scientific; conversely, a theory which is compatible with all such observations, either because, as in the case of Marxism, it has been modified solely to accommodate such observations, or because, as in the case of psychoanalytic theories, it is consistent with all possible observations, is unscientific. For Popper, however, to assert that a theory is unscientific, is not necessarily to hold that it is unenlightening, still less that it is meaningless, for it sometimes happens that a theory which is unscientific (because it is unfalsifiable) at a given time may become falsifiable, and thus scientific, with the development of technology, or with the further articulation and refinement of the theory. Further, even purely mythogenic explanations have performed a valuable function in the past in expediting our understanding of the nature of reality.\n\n...\n\nAs Popper represents it, the central problem in the philosophy of science is that of demarcation, i.e., of distinguishing between science and what he terms \u2018non-science\u2019, under which heading he ranks, amongst others, logic, metaphysics, psychoanalysis, and Adler's individual psychology. Popper is unusual amongst contemporary philosophers in that he accepts the validity of the Humean critique of induction, and indeed, goes beyond it in arguing that induction is never actually used by the scientist. However, he does not concede that this entails the scepticism which is associated with Hume, and argues that the Baconian/Newtonian insistence on the primacy of \u2018pure\u2019 observation, as the initial step in the formation of theories, is completely misguided: all observation is selective and theory-laden\u2014there are no pure or theory-free observations. In this way he destabilises the traditional view that science can be distinguished from non-science on the basis of its inductive methodology; in contradistinction to this, Popper holds that there is no unique methodology specific to science. Science, like virtually every other human, and indeed organic, activity, Popper believes, consists largely of problem-solving.\nPopper, then, repudiates induction, and rejects the view that it is the characteristic method of scientific investigation and inference, and substitutes falsifiability in its place. It is easy, he argues, to obtain evidence in favour of virtually any theory, and he consequently holds that such \u2018corroboration\u2019, as he terms it, should count scientifically only if it is the positive result of a genuinely \u2018risky\u2019 prediction, which might conceivably have been false. For Popper, a theory is scientific only if it is refutable by a conceivable event. Every genuine test of a scientific theory, then, is logically an attempt to refute or to falsify it, and one genuine counter-instance falsifies the whole theory. In a critical sense, Popper's theory of demarcation is based upon his perception of the logical asymmetry which holds between verification and falsification: it is logically impossible to conclusively verify a universal proposition by reference to experience (as Hume saw clearly), but a single counter-instance conclusively falsifies the corresponding universal law. In a word, an exception, far from \u2018proving\u2019 a rule, conclusively refutes it.\nEvery genuine scientific theory then, in Popper's view, is prohibitive, in the sense that it forbids, by implication, particular events or occurrences. As such it can be tested and falsified, but never logically verified. Thus Popper stresses that it should not be inferred from the fact that a theory has withstood the most rigorous testing, for however long a period of time, that it has been verified; rather we should recognise that such a theory has received a high measure of corroboration. and may be provisionally retained as the best available theory until it is finally falsified (if indeed it is ever falsified), and/or is superseded by a better theory.\n\nHowever, using this philosophy, we can only claim that certain logical arguments are non-scientific, rather than non-useful. Expanding the debate to cover other philosophers of science, the nature of falsifablilty and the objective reality behind it may be a fuction of one's paradigm (Kuhn) or Research Programme (Lakatos).\nIt is not appropriate to apply the requirements of science to any logical argument, as not all logical arguments presume predictive power of the \"real\" world as part of their givens. When considering constructed realities (like computer protocols) it is even worthwhile to explicitly forbid considerations of the real, as they do not apply within the subjective and constructed (but logical) arguments therein.\n"}]}

Or those terms are not mutually exclusive and one can be both?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The two forms of egoism are actually closely related to one another.\nPsychological egoism is essentially the observation that humans are characteristically motivated by their own self-interest. When they choose to take an action, it is ultimately going to be one that provides them some personal benefit (directly or indirectly), regardless of how altruistic it may appear to observers. \nEthical egoism is an ethical position claiming that the morally right actions for an agent are exactly those that maximize the agent's self-interest. The only moral guideline for an action is whether it increases our own happiness. This taken to its logical conclusion implies that all moral agents ought to do that which is in their own self-interest. Of course, it does not require the infliction of any harm or pain upon others, but at the same time, it explicitly disavows the existence of an overarching moral obligation to help or serve others, arguing that an individual moral agent ought not treat one's self (\"the subject\") any differently than she treats others, and that the interests and desires of others ought not be placed above those of the same.\nAs I see it, the only significant area of conflict between the two forms is that psychological egoism is explicitly non-normative, whereas ethical egoism is a normative philosophy. Normativity is a winding and fairly convoluted concept, but the important component here is with regards to the differing types of statements that are made by each philosophical viewpoint.\nA normative view tends to be one that is prescriptivist; that is, it speaks about what one ought \u00a0to do. Normative theories attempt to prescribe behavior and enumerate principles that advise what one should \u00a0do in a particular situation. By contrast, a non-normative view is one that makes claims only about how things are, rather than how they ought to be. Fundamentally, the difference is one of is \u00a0vs. ought \u00a0statements.\nAnd thus, one could argue that she is a psychological egoist purely because she believes that the position is fundamentally consistent with human nature, not because she thinks that actions which benefit only the self are either necessary or sufficient to achieve morality. In layman's terms, I could agree that such is how the world is, but not like it or endorse it. That would make me a psychological egoist, but not an ethical egoist.\nBut on the other hand, it would be relatively more difficult for an ethical egoist to distance herself from psychological egoism entirely. In fact, one of the justifications for ethical egoism might be its consistency with human nature, that moral agents are fundamentally given to look after their own welfare first before attempting to secure the welfare of others\u2014an argument from the psychological egoist school of thought. Of course, there are plenty of other possible justifications, but the point remains that an ethical egoist is likely to also accept psychological egoism, whereas it would be theoretically possible for a psychological egoist to reject the prescriptive tenets of ethical egoism.\n"}]}

Before the development of modern science, philosophy and science were seen as one in the same. In fact, many long-established universities still appoint \"Chairs of Natural Philosophy\", commonly occupied by professors of physical science nowadays.\nThere is also an entire division of philosophy known as the \"philosophy of science\" that's concerned with such things as the development of the scientific method.

This would, in fact, mean that the trustworthiness of SM would be weaker when applied to Philosophy.\n2 - The wikipedia\u00b9 takes the Oxford English Dictionary definition of SM to be:\n\"a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.\"\nIf we give up the How \u00d7 Why distinction, I'd say again that yes: we can apply SM to Philosophy where all (or at least most) of necessary parts are present. If philosophy rarely applies full SM, it's because the studied subjects are more speculative and difficult to \"square\" in the SM framework.\nAbout the trustworthiness, I don't see any problem \"by definition\", although if we don't have all the component parts of the method, we'll not get it to exert its full power.\nOne should have in mind that this kind of question is always puzzled with the problems of defining what is philosophy. Maybe some of the appealing character of this question comes from the fact that some people who try to define philosophy take as one of the basic characteristics the non-experimental factor, so this opposition (with which I don't agree) emerges.\n\u00b9 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method\n"}]}

In other words, both readings, if applied to the whole of the text, would classify it as belonging to something beyond the limits of \"world, thought and language\". \nIt seems safe to assume that Wittgenstein's purpose in writing the Tractatus was not to expound a litany of senseless or nonsensical propositions supported solely on the basis of a private language. Interpretation based on (in)austere readings of sense may be convenient; however, any interpretation should follow intent lest it be some prattling on about how a square peg doesn't fit into a circlular hole.\nAn alternate interpretation (to apply to the possibility of meaning or sensibility of the propositions) is how they are meaningful/less, their correspondence to states of affairs (SOA). In this strictest sense, logic and (particularly) the methods of logic written about in the Tractatus are senseless. This was by virtue of Wittgenstein's differentiation of the operation of the rules of logic and their lack of correspondence with any possible SOA.\nWhat remains of the Tractatus after the statements of logic are stripped away? Ignoring the side debate of whether a claim instantiated by nonsense or senseless proposition is thereby corrupted, it is wholly possible to read through the Tractatus as a work of the unsayable. Further, in Letters from Ludwig Wittgenstein it is expressed that he intended the work to be read with an eye to the ethical (think more Vienna Circle, less Analytics). Here is a summation of what this can mean (TLP citations):\n\n...as everything that is possible can in-principle be put into words, it follows that if there are 'things' which cannot be put into words then such 'things' cannot exist within logical space. This reinforces the claim that some nonsense might have an important use, namely, to try and illuminate those 'truths' which cannot be said. By attempting to say what cannot be said, by speaking nonsense (but not meaningless gibberish), one can try to make the things which cannot be put into words mystically \u00abmanifest\u00bb themselves through words (6.522). While we will inevitably pass over such things in silence, this does not necessarily imply that we should be silent as we can try to manifest them in order to help others \u00absee the world aright\u00bb (6.54). Indeed, this is what I take Wittgenstein to be trying to do throughout the Tractatus. For Wittgenstein there are ethical `truths' that cannot, strictly speaking, be said at all, but can only be 'manifested' through illuminating nonsense...

So the major consequence of this is that scientific theories are meaningless to the extent they deal with unobservable phenomena, or do not provide computable rules for predicting observable events. Insofar as I understand it, to an instrumentalist a scientific theory is a set of functions -- purely a practical instrument for problem solving. We get to bypass the realism-idealism debate, since an instrumentalist would discourage us from drawing any conclusions about ultimate \"truth\". \nIn other words, instrumentalism suggests the practical utility of a theory is primary, that theories are nothing more than predictive algorithms, and that our reliance on them is no proof of their transcendent verity but reflects only the degree to which the relevant theory has proven effective at solving problems and predicting observable phenomena (rather than the degree to which they describe the character of an underlying reality.)\nIn Conjectures and Refutations, Popper criticizes instrumentalism for being too mechanical, and plainly reductive with respect to \"purer\" sciences:\n\nInstrumentalism can be formulated as the thesis that scientific theories - the theories of the so-called \"pure\" sciences - are nothing but computational rules (or inference rules); of the same character, fundamentally, as the computation rules of the so-called \"applied\" sciences. (One might even formulate it as the thesis that \"pure\" science is a misnomer, and that all science is \"applied\".)

Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.\n\nPierce reformulated this several years later (Peirce, 1905, from \"Issues of Pragmaticism\" in The Monist v. XV, n. 4, pp. 481-499, see p. 481 via Google Books and via Internet Archive):\n\nThe entire intellectual purport of any symbol consists in the total of all general modes of rational conduct which, conditionally upon all the possible different circumstances and desires, would ensue upon the acceptance of the symbol.\n\nIn another excerpt from that document, this time clearly showing some instrumentalist-leaning concerns:\n\nIn order to ascertain the meaning of an intellectual conception one should consider what practical consequences might conceivably result by necessity from the truth of that conception; and the sum of these consequences will constitute the entire meaning of the conception.\n\n"}]}

There will always be large unknown variables.\nThe opposite is anything that precludes any weighing at all, such as cast-iron principles (\"I will not take another's life, no matter what\") or ethics solely based on intentions that are unrelated to results (\"if you do it for God, it doesn't matter what you do; if you do it with the intention of pleasing God, you may kill as many as you feel is necessary\").\nHowever, it could be said, which Dimo hints at, that all ethics unwittingly work within a Utilitarian framework, rendering the term meaningless: if pleasing God is the highest goal in ethics, because that is my only moral obligation, I can weigh the results of my actions according to that model. Shall I destroy Timbuktu or not? I know God commands me to do it, and so Timbuktu's destruction is the moral thing to do. Not destroying it weight zero.\nThus it would seem reasonable to include in the definition of Utilitarianism some more specific goals, like people's physical well-being as a positive weight, or the fulfilment of their desires. But even these two goals are controversial among Utilitarians.\nIn practice, whenever I think \"your decision is impractical and could profit from a more Utilitarian point of view\", I just want to tell people, \"think more about the practical results of your actions, instead of these mere principles; you have adopted them seemingly at random, and you are unwittingly giving them far too much weight in your narrow-minded motivation, forgetting the true purpose for which you have invented those principles in the first place\".\n"}]}

Kaufmann)\n\nHe praises Goethe in a number of his works for having been a \"free spirit,\" something that Nietzsche himself expressed desire to be. And again, we recall that the \u00dcbermensch is one who embodies the free spirit par excellence. \nIn Twilight of the Idols, IX \u00a749, Nietzsche writes with regard to Goethe's Dionysian character:\n\nGoethe\u2014\u2026a grand attempt to overcome the eighteenth century through a return to nature, through a going-up to the naturalness of the Renaissance, a kind of self-overcoming on the part of that century\u2026He did not sever himself from life, he placed himself within it\u2026and took as much as possible upon himself, above himself, within himself. What he aspired to was totality; he strove against the separation of reason, sensibility, emotion, will\u2026; he disciplined himself to a whole, he created himself\u2026 Goethe conceived of a strong, highly cultured human being who, keeping himself in check and having reverence for himself, dares to allow himself the whole compass and wealth of naturalness, who is strong enough for this freedom; a man of tolerance, not out of weakness but out of strength, because he knows how to employ to his advantage what would destroy an average nature; a man to whom nothing is forbidden, except it be weakness, whether that weakness be called vice or virtue\u2026 A spirit thus emancipated stands in the middle of the universe with a joyful and trusting fatalism, in the faith that only what is separate and individual may be rejected, that in the totality everything is redeemed and affirmed\u2014he no longer denies\u2026 But such a faith is the highest of all possible faiths: I have baptised it with the name Dionysus.\n\nIt's certainly poetic, but in addition to Goethe, Nietzsche also offers up great admiration (most pronounced in his earlier works) for Schopenhauer, a man who was able to reconcile action and contemplation, and voluntarily chose to give up both comfort and happiness in life, courageously confronting the suffering of the human condition in a positive and affirming way. Schopenhauer seemed to Nietzsche to have transformed life's many hardships into a cheerful disposition, a characteristically \u00dcbermenschlich activity. He is also quite taken with Rousseau, whom he sees as a revolutionary.\nThus, I remain skeptical of any pursuit to identify the true \u00dcbermensch, as per Nietzsche. He wasn't particularly bashful, and it's unlikely that he would have avoided naming someone directly if he thought they really merited the title. It's quite important throughout Nietzsche's work that no one has ever truly achieved the status of \u00dcbermensch. It's why he himself found the concept difficult to describe at times. Note that he describes the \u00dcbermensch as \"belonging to the future\": he has never fully existed, neither in the being of Goethe nor of anyone else. \nIn my opinion, few academics have taken up the question of who is/was the \"true\" \u00dcbermensch because such a question is irrelevant and might, in fact, be harmful, at least to the extent that it detracts from the fundamental point that Nietzsche is trying to make.\nAs far as other scholarly references, the best one I know of dealing with extra-literary questions like this one is Kaufmann's own Nietzsche: philosopher, psychologist, antichrist. He devotes several sections to a discussion on the \u00dcbermensch concept, and mentions Goethe (and the other contenders) specifically.\nYou might also find this article interesting (if you have access to scholarly journals through a service like Project Muse).

For instance, if one were to try to attempt an argument with a Westerner that Hitler was not, in fact evil (embodied, incarnate, etc), and rather that his actions were evil, then the argument would likely be met with hostility. The repulsion any sane person has for any genocide turns for explanation not first to mental stability, psychopathy, or any other empirical basis; sane people frequently turn first to evil. Evil, in particular, seems to have a sense of being simulataneously some possessing substance and an inexhaustible repository for actions. It is not precisely (in the g/e spectrum) an eleven or fifteen on some scale of 1-10 where 10 is bad; it has an unquantifiable measure to it.\nThe point here being, good and evil are not merits of a person when thinking of the \"Good and Evil\" in your question. The problem of evil is a metaphysical one for many Westerners. As much as a person I know angers me, I personally know no one who is evil. There are always exigencies to explain their behavior. When we reach out to affect a trend and understand something beyond our scope of experience (these are always harder to find out; i.e. you didn't know that your boss was a psychopath, but it sure does explain a lot), we are less prone to seek out the actual exigencies and more apt to generalize and appeal to some Deus Ex Machina... like evil.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY, Buddhism does not\nparticularly have some corporeal\nconcept for \"Evil\"; neither does\nHinduism, Shintoism, Taoism, Bon,\nShintoism, nor does fetishism,\ntotemism, or animism facilitate such\na concept.

Moreover, I'm going to limit this answer to just Chinese philosophy.\nThe Chinese language has had words for good and evil since far before any encounter with Western thought - \u5584 shan and \u60aa e respectively. \nWithin Chinese philosophy, in the Confucian school, a central question is a dispute between Xunzi and Mengzi (\"Mencius\") about whether human beings are innately good or evil. Mencius takes the view that all humans have a root of goodness in them (2A2 for the four roots, 6A2, 6A6 for the claim they are good), i.e. the tendency if not stifled for people to wind up as good (read more at the SEP article Mencius). For Xunzi, human nature is evil and only made good by strict discipline (see Wm Theodore DeBary's translation).\nThe SEP article suggests that the Daoist text Zhuangzi is written by people who have read Mencius and consciously reject the four roots and the notion that goodness has a well and tidied definition. This can be interpreted as inspired as either a rejection of categories in general or a rejection that rejects the \"Confucian\"  / general definition of these categories.\nThis particular interpretive issue reminds me of one faced by the interpreters of Nietzsche -- if you take Nietzsche to be against all morality, then the higher men parts don't make any sense; if you take him to be against just a type of supposedly Judeo-Christian slavish morality, then what's he's proposing is an alternative view that has its own concepts of good and evil (see SEP: Nietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy). In other words \"Beyond Good and Evil\" is either no more rules or beyond good and evil as they define it. So then the question is whether the Daoists (or at least some of them) are merely rejecting the Confucian good/evil understanding or any understanding of good/evil. The inner chapters of the Zhuangzi seem to suggest they have ideals about how people should interact with nature which if memory serves get called \"good\" (51 different paragraphs according to ctext).\nWhat about yin/yang? Doesn't that say there's light in darkness and darkness in light? One of the main original sources of this in Chinese thought is the I Ching (book of changes), which also contains a bunch of hexagram patterns and their interpretations. This text is not mentioned in the Analects, Mengzi, etc. It does feature prominently in Neo-Confucianism (starting from around 1100 CE) as part of their need to have a metaphysic to combat the one coming from Buddhist competitors at the time).\nMoreover, even yin/yang does not clearly negate the idea of good / evil. Instead, it shifts it somewhat in a similar direction to the Zhuangzi. Rather than seeking a pure idealized good, it makes it so that the goal is to be in touch with this not inherently moral nature (here nature under the meaning of the world around us rather than essence).\nThere's some really interesting reading on whether this has anything like the Western notion of a \"problem of evil\" in Franklin Perkins book, Heaven and Earth are not Humane. The book looks at both Confucian and Daoist responses to the fact of evil in the world.\n\nOne part of your question that I didn't address in very much detail was the \"dueling notion\" part. A major impetus is that I'm not sure I understand what is being asked on that particular front. If the question is, does Chinese thought put good in conflict with evil? Then, my answer would be yes. Is there a high God who is at war with Satan and evil? Then, in general (with the possible exception of some interpretation of \u5929 tian), the answer is no. \nIs there a world where we need to marshall resources to keep the good alive? Then, for the Confucian school, yes. For the Daoists, then sort of kind of, but with \"good\" needing to be understood in a very distinct light that should not be confused with say traditional morality or being a part of normalish Chinese society. Instead, it's a type of convergence with \u9053 Dao (whether understood as \u7136 zi (nature) or something distinct), that does not get confused with the \"good\" dictated by society.\n"}]}

As I see, most mythologies in the world explain it by bipolarity (e.g. the North and South in a magnet cannot be set apart, so the good and evil are both necessary parts of every individual -- of course not so balanced as the simpler magnetic analogy, but they can't be isolated as well). Monotheisms explain it by dualism (like Platonic reality/ideality, good and evil are isolated things, so one person may be 100% good, and another 100% evil. That's the basis of maniqueism, and also a root for the melodrama that stains most of our cultural production, instead of the richer Greek tradition of tragedy, as illustrated by Sophocles' Oedipus). You can read more about this distinction in Marc Hal\u00e9vy's Lecture du Tao: une sagesse qui nous attend... (2012).\nNow some more detail, about the question itself and about virmaior's answer:\nI doubt that \"shan\" alone may represent our word \"good\", as well as \"e\" alone our word \"evil\". That's because hao \u597d, liang \u826f, jia \u4f73, guai \u4e56, mei \u7f8e, jia \u5609, as well as lianghao \u826f\u597d, youliang \u4f18\u826f, nashou \u62ff\u624b, bulai \u4e0d\u8d56... all mean \"good\". So the translation here is far from direct or simple. If \"to know\" may be translated by more than 10 different characters, then we're probably \"out of words\". Both Confucius' Analects and Orwell's 1984 have taught us about the importance of the right words, but the West doesn't seem to be listening (or reading).\nAlso, this methodology brings its own problems: guai \u4e56 is also \"perverse\", \"contrary to reason\", \"abnormal\". A similar problem in translation is chang \u5e38, which may be translated as \"common\", \"usual\" and at the same time \"eternal\", \"unchanging\". This simple character interfered with centuries of Western translations of the Chinese texts (most translators, saturated with monotheism, choose the latter meaning of chang, although the former is more significant in the light of both the remaining text and the findings in animal behavior or physics).\nThat being said, primitive Daoism apparently agrees with Mengzi's vision in virmaior's 3rd paragraph. The Dao De Jing (57) says \"I do nothing and the people are reformed of themselves. I love quietude and the people are righteous of themselves. I deal in no business and the people grow rich by themselves. I have no desires and the people are simple and honest by themselves.\" [Lin Yutang 1955 http://web.archive.org/web/20110514203735/http://home.pages.at/onkellotus/TTK/English_Yutang_TTK.html#Kap57] That's a great definition of \"good\" to me, though the character shan \u5584 is absent.\nIn a modern, scientific world-view, biology says that any social species will know how to tell good from evil. That's illustrated in Jane Goodall's book \"Through a Window\", when the group of Gombe chimpanzees isolates an old female who kills an infant.\nThis Daoist point of view is also exemplified in the movie K-PAX (2001), where Kevin Spacey's character replies to his restless, frustrated doctor, who is asking about his \"other-worldly society\", which is described as having no rules or government. The doctor asks \"How do you know right from wrong?\", to which the \"alien\" answers the obvious: \"Every being in the Universe knows right from wrong, Mark.\" That's a great movie about Daoist thinking. Remembering that the society described by the \"alien\" is strikingly similar to those existent all over America, which were unmercifully destroyed by so-called Christians \"devoted to good\".\nSo, to conclude: yes, Eastern philosophies are well aware of the good/evil problem, but no, they don't posit this two concepts as \"dueling\", but are able to recognize their \"complementarity\", opposed to those who, trying to bring us \"100% good\" actually brought some of us \"100% evil\"...\n"}]}

And just as The Bible is the Holy Book for both Jews and Christians, The Avesta, was and is still, the Holy Text for Zoroastrians in India-(known as, \"Parsis\") and Iran-(whereby a tiny minority of Zoroastrians reside), as well as other parts of the world.\nThe Metaphysical or Supernatural dualism that is found within The Koran and in parts of The New Testament, actually originated with the Zoroastrian Avesta and predate both The New Testament and The Koran by many centuries. And although Supernatural dualism can be found as far back as the Book of Genesis in The Old Testament, the constant warring of Good versus Evil-(i.e.  Metaphysical/ Supernatural Dualism), is not necessarily a Central theme within the many Books of The Old Testament, whereas the constant War between the Supernatural Good and Evil, is a Central theme within The Zoroastrian Avesta and Zoroastrian Theology. In fact, it is the Metaphysical/Supernatural Duality that is the Foundation for Zoroastrianism, whereas such Supernatural dualities are not necessarily the Foundation for the above mentioned faiths.\nInterestingly, the mighty and vast Ancient Persian Empire-(600 BC/BCE-330 BC/BCE), which spanned from Northern India, to Western Anatolia-(present-day Turkey), never proselytized or converted its imperial subjects.  Zoroastrianism and its dualistic ethical teachings, were pretty much confined to the ethnic Persian populations of Iran and Uzbekistan.  Imperial subjects retained their respective religious faiths, though some Ancient Greek Philosophers, especially, Heraclitus of Ephesus, were probably influenced by some of the (Pre-Dialectical/Dualistic) teachings of Zoroastrianism.\nChristianity never came to Persia/Iran, though Persian Zoroastrianism did influence and impact some of the Early Church Teachings, particularly, Manicheanism and appears to have had a great influence on The Western Church, during its early years.  And Persian Zoroastrianism had a significant influence on Islam as well.\nSo when looking at the origins of Metaphysical/Supernatural Dualism, one can see that Zoroastrianism helped to pioneer such concepts and influences around the world for over 2500 years.\n"}]}

Their criticisms draw from the traditional Marxist school of thought, arguing that these types of societies force people to engage in alienated labor, pulling them away from things that naturally belong together as part of the systematic oppressive process of capitalism. As dogmatic capitalism begins to erase individual identity, boredom becomes a systemic problem. Fromm specifically argues that the never-ending search for novel thrills that characterizes consumerism in industrial capitalist societies is not seeking a solution to boredom, but rather a distraction from the problem of boredom, driving it further into our subconscious minds. And drawing it one step further, Fromm cites boredom as being the driving force behind \"aggression and destructiveness today\" in his paper, the Theory of Aggression.\nHeidegger takes issue with the mechanization of capitalism and how it contributes to boredom. He gives the example of an automobile assembly line, which requires continual physical engagement on the part of the operator, but no real conscious thought. One looks \"busy\", but really is just perpetually waiting, waiting for the tedium of the job to be over, waiting for someone else to finish a task, etc.\nFor more on this line of thought, I strongly suggest reading Herbert Marcuse's One-Dimensional Man. It's a great introduction to the Frankfurt School and their thoughts on the culture industry and capitalism while remaining somewhat uncharacteristically lucid. It introduces the idea of \"consumerism\" as a form of social control, which is truly revolutionary.\n\nTaking a slightly different angle, it's also a notable concept in existentialist literature. Heidegger himself picks up the topic of boredom a second time in his writings on \"nothingness\" and the meaning[lessness] of existence. To him, boredom reveals a lot about Dasein. In Being and Time, his most famous work, he writes:\n\nEven and precisely then when we are not actually busy with things or ourselves this \u201cas a whole\u201d overcomes us \u2014 for example in genuine boredom. Boredom is still distant when it is only this book or that play, that business or this idleness, that drags on. It irrupts when \u201cone is bored.\u201d Profound boredom, drifting here and there in the abysses of our existence like a muffling fog, removes all things and men and oneself along with it into a remarkable indifference. This boredom reveals beings as a whole.\n\nThat is, this boredom works to create a pervasive state of anxiety in which Dasein begins to truly reveal itself. Heidegger and the question of psychology is a great introduction to this line of thought that doesn't require actually reading Heidegger's own characteristically dense (perhaps impossible?) prose.\nArthur Schopenhauer (notable, among other reasons, for his profound influence on Nietzsche) also takes up the topic of boredom, arguing that it actually proves the vanity of human existence. He reasons that if life was truly possessive of positive value and real content, then there should be no such thing altogether as boredom. He asks, shouldn't mere existence be enough to both fulfill and satisfy us? The entire book containing this discussion (Essays and aphorisms) is actually available online through Google Books. You might consider reading through it sometime when you're, erm, bored.\nAnd if you have access to scholarly periodicals through a site like SpringerLink, you might try and ferret out a copy of Patrick Bigelow's The Ontology of Boredom, which seems like it might be a direct answer to your primary curiosities.\n"}]}

I see meditation as an intentional engagement with boredom. If we consider how a monk say an immured one, is different from a prisoner locked in a cell, the difference is clearly about attitude, rather than circumstance. I would argue meditation helps to investigate non-conscious sources of impulses.\nI see boredom as our biological drive, pushing us to practice and keep skills and faculties accessible. So we see children experience it most strongly, fitting with their neural plasticity, e.g. rapid language learning capacities.  From antagonistic pleiotropy (a gene is considered to possess it if it controls more than one trait, where at least one of these traits is beneficial to the organism's fitness early on in life and at least one is detrimental to the organism's fitness later on due to a decline in reproductive impacts there) that behavior that stops influencing reproduction will stop being selected for. Boredom is a universal trait among children, so we can interpret as serving biology. Over time being selected for conditions of needing to tolerate boredom, we could expect a species to adapt to be more comfortable with it, e.g. in domesticated animals, a dog's brain is 15% smaller than a wolf's which we can relate to different selection pressures. We enrich the lives of children with toys and education, in order to enhance their development of capacities, and their tolerating boredom more would mean their learning less.\nEdited to add\nBiologist Denis Noble argues from the opposite direction to this 'gene's eye' view, that genes which code for open-ended creative behaviours are the most useful for serving the needs of organisns, like say FOXP2, the 'language genes' seem to stimulate babbling which enables language development, rather than hard-coding language like say the Universal Grammar hypothesis describes.\n"}]}

It merely asks whether an ideology or proposition works successfully. The answer to that question is considered sufficient to establish such idea or proposal as true; meaning is found only in the practical consequences of accepting a notion. Drawn to its logical conclusion, unpractical ideas are necessarily rejected, not out of any strict moral code, but merely because they fail to satisfactorily guide the inquiry of knowledge. This is the pragmatic maxim first proposed by Peirce. It is a strictly normative recommendation that sets up a standard for truth.\nThe primary question asked by a pragmatist could be envisioned as:\n\nWhat concrete, practical difference would it make if that theory were true and its opposite were false?\n\nThey would reject the idea (or at least the relevance of such an idea) that there are facts that are, in principle, unknowable. Talk of inaccessible Kantian \"things-in-themselves\", or the Nietzschean \"True World\" that is forever hidden behind the veil of phenomena is considered to be useless, merely idle chat.\nBy contrast, utilitarianism is a moral philosophy. It holds that the utility of a particular action in providing the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure to sentient beings is both necessary and sufficient to establish its moral worth. It aims to measure the morality of an action, rather than merely assess its normative truth value. The conclusion of a utilitarian calculus is that the action is good or bad, right or wrong, moral or immoral. Pragmatists do not render the same type of judgment; it is not meant to guide moral evaluation or moral decision-making.\nThe line probably begins to blur as you get into neo-pragmatism, those contemporary thinkers whose work has been widely held to be \"pragmatist\", like J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Hilary Putnam (although, \"pragmatically\"-speaking, it's awfully hard to nail down what his position actually is), etc. Some of them have drawn moral conclusions from pragmatist rationale. But in general, the distinction is still one of a moral-ethical system, as compared to a normative truth-based system.\n"}]}

As such it was during all of the 19th century in practice equivalent to socialism and could be used more or less interchangeably. \nAlthough the early usage of the word \"Capitalism\" meant having stock exchanges and investors, since the 19th century the word has acquired the more fundamental meaning of \"private ownership of property\".\nIn these senses of the word, capitalism vs communism is indeed a dichotomy, as something  either is owned communally or not. Either everyone has a say over the usage of the property or not everyone has a say. (Although you can have both common ownership and private ownership at the same time, but of different things. As such hospitals may be owned by the state, but car factories not, for example).\nIn this viewpoint the left was definitely not stuck between a false dichotomy, as the dichotomy was true, and they had chosen one side of it.\nHowever, the meaning of the word communism started changing after the Russian revolution. Socialism continued to mean common ownership, but Communism more and more meant a specific path to socialism, namely Marxism including it's bloody revolution and dictatorship of the proletariat. \nAs such, the dichotomy starts being false. Although the dichotomy between socialism and capitalism remains, communism then became just one form of socialism, with most notably reformist and democratic social democracy as a major option. But the \"the left\" was not caught in this false dichotomy, because social democrats tried that option. Only that part of the left (which got smaller and smaller every year) that still supported the communist dictatorships could be said to be confined in a false dichotomy. A confinement completely of their own choosing, of course.\nAfter the fall of communism and the gradual realization that social democracy hasn't delivered, the word \"communism\" has again started to change meaning. \"Social democracy\" increasingly means what before would be called \"social liberalism\", capitalism with a strong protective state, \"socialism\" increasingly means \"politicians being nice to people\" and \"communism\" is starting to revert to its original meaning of \"common ownership\". As such, the dichotomy between communism and capitalism is again becoming a real one.\nI would therefore say that:\nNo, the European left was not confined in a false dichotomy between capitalism and communism, unless you with \"The European Left\" means only those who supported or still support the communist dictatorships because they dislike capitalism. But that is a very narrow definition of \"The European Left\" (although undoubtedly some of this left was and is so sectarian that they wouldn't hesitate to agree with it).\n"}]}

The quote says Camus saw oppression in the Soviet Union (and the Soviet system in general) as the \"primary problem for the left\" post-war. That is hardly the same thing as him feeling forced into a choice between Communism and Capitalism. \nIn fact, if you go a little further in the synopsis you'll read:\n\nCamus, for his part, grew increasingly hostile to Marxism and flirted\n  with anarchism, writing for a time in Revolution Proletarienne and\n  advocating revolutionary trade unionism as a substitute for the\n  leadership of the Communist Party.\n\nThis paragraph in and of itself seems to answer the question of the title, since Camus clearly didn't see an exclusive choice between Soviet Communism and US-style Capitalism (Revolutionary trade unionism would be an alternative to both). \nBut we don't only have to think about these two French intellectuals. There was a considerable amount of diversity in Western Europe. \nMost of the thinkers associated with the Frankfurt School (a German Marxist group of academics), for example, were explicitly anti-Soviet. Herbert Marcuse in his One-Dimensional Man (1964) essentially characterizes Soviet Communism and western Capitalism as manifestations of the same modern control system that he criticizes, and this equal disgust at the US/Western Europe and Soviet systems can be seen in Erich Fromm and Theodor Adorno (e.g. Dialectic of Enlightenment, 1944), too. \nSo, I would say that the answer is no, the left wasn't confined in a false dichotomy between communism and capitalism post-war. The actual dichotomy on the left immediately post-war was not between capitalism and communism, but between whether the Soviet Union should represent the rallying-point of the \"international\" Left, or whether it was basically an abomination of Marxist teachings that should be denounced along with capitalism (Marxists keen to stick to their usual language could diss the USSR by referring to their system as \"state capitalism\"). \nRemember that for Marxists and many leftists, the USSR was a manifestation of Marx's predictions in the real world. The idea was, you jump on the train or history will pass you by. It's sad but not surprising that it took so long for Stalin to be universally denounced by the left. By the mid-1960's, though, you had tons of new anti-USSR left-leaning groups across Europe (see continental european new left)\n"}]}

[Knows his place (live at his place), and protects what he\n  has!]\n\nVoltaire based this on the Italian proverb, Il meglio \u00e8 l\u2019inimico del bene, which means exactly the same. The origin of the proverb appears to be unknown.\nHe uses the Italian phrase himself in his Art dramatique. First he describes how the work of Lulli is misinterpreted by a certain encyclopaedia of art; then he \"proves\" how wrong it is (if I understand the text correctly), and ends with the proverb. I don't think it could be read otherwise than Lulli being the good, and the all-too artificial encyclopaedia being the \"better\".\nIncidentally, I ask, how did Voltaire learn this proverb? He must have heard someone else use it. And either that person must have used it the same way Voltaire uses it, or Voltaire must have misunderstood. Is the latter likely? I imagine this person used it in a context that let Voltaire interpret it this way; it seems possible, but unlikely, that he misinterpreted it. \nSuppose there were two women, Cleopatra and Xanthippe. Suppose Cleopatra were the enemy of Xanthippe. Who would you say was more aggressive? I say we know that Cleopatra is probably aggressive, but Xanthippe might be either aggressive or merely fearful of Cleopatra. Being someone's enemy is often reciprocal, but not necessarily so. In any case, if one party is called an \"enemy\", emphasis lies on that party's ill will.\nAnalogously, the better harms the good, but we aren't told whether the good harms the better as well. It seems clear that it is the harmful effect of the better that has focus, not the other way around. Moreover, the main statement is dans son \u00e9tat, heureux qui peut se plaire; the phrase non qu'on ne puisse augmenter en prudence etc. (\"not that...\") is an exception he makes. The main statement is reinforced by the evocative word chim\u00e8re. What comes before non que... belongs to the main statement.\nAny text can be interpreted in various ways, many of which would be the opposite of what the author meant. If an author inspires you to contemplate something you know he didn't intend, that is of course fine and well\u2014as long as you don't try and read it into his other lines. We are not Voltaire's servants: if we should like the wordplay of this expression's meaning \"the good is the enemy of the better\", we are free to do so.\n"}]}

Now it seems to me that Voltaire is either expanding on the sentiment expressed by the Italian sage, or reinterpreting it.  (I don't think we can tell which unless we find the original.)  In either case, what we read here is in itself a form of reader-response criticism.\nIf I read it correctly, the poem seems to set wisdom, morality1, talents and knowledge2 apart from other pursuits when it comes to selecting the \"better\" or the \"good\".  In turn that would mean that the good in those fields might prevent us from striving for the better, but the hope of the better in other areas of life might prevent us from enjoying the good.  Could it not therefore be taken in either sense depending on where it is applied?\nIn terms of the propriety of reader-response criticism and if it will lead to madness, I think it depends on whether you've first taken seriously the task of understanding the author's original intent.

Skepticism is a tool in the philosophers toolbox and reason is the mighty pillar on which the entire project of philosophy rests.  Certainly it is often rational to be skeptical, but to imagine that skepticism is always or even usually the most rational course of action seems, well, foolish.\nPhilosophical Skepticism finds it's basis on the idea that reason is founded on some set of axioms which are not themselves provable.  Even Descartes' cogito ergo sum must be accepted without proof, since it amounts to a circular argument.  (The first term assumes the existence of a thinker, which is the conclusion the argument tries to reach.)  But there are other tools in the philosopher's shed besides the hammer of skepticism.  We could, for instance, simply agree on some common set of axioms on which to base our dialog.\nExtreme skepticism is in fact self-defeating.  According the the Wikipedia article linked in the question, \"philosophical skepticism is an approach that denies the possibility of knowledge\".  Therefore philosophical skepticism can not claim even that philosophical skepticism is correct.  Therefore a critic of philosophical skepticism can not be compelled to accept any of its claims.\n\nHere's an interesting comment this answer received:\n\nIf you believe that no truth is safe from doubt, you're a skeptic. \u2013 philosodad\n\nLet's call that statement (a).  I believe that it is mistaken and I'll use this space to explain why.\nNow this statement is clearly true by definition:\n\n(b) If you're a skeptic, you believe that no truth is safe from doubt.\n\n(For the moment, we'll ignore the various types of skeptics and stick with this concise definition.)  It's clear that (a) does not follow from (b), so proving (a) requires more work.  But immediately, if you start with (b), there's a potential contradiction: according to (b) a skeptic does not believe that (b) is safe from doubt and it's possible that it's not true.  Which leaves me stuck before I even get started.  In fact, no truth may be derived from (b) that is safe from doubt if you are a skeptic.\nBut my answer assumes doubt and skepticism hold a different place in philosophy than a starting point.  Rather, I hold that a good set of axioms should include Cromwell's Rule:\n\n(c) I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.\n  - Oliver Cromwell\n\nAs a starting point, (c) is not better than (b).  But it doesn't claim to be a starting point.  In fact, you have to already believe something is true before you can begin to apply Cromwell's Rule.  There are some axioms that are so likely to be true that we can safely say they are true.  But according to (c), we must be prepared to change our minds given sufficient evidence.  Suppose we hold, for instance:\n\n(d) All participants on philosophy.stackexchange.com are human.\n\nI'd say (d) is true.  But if one of the participants reveals that they are in fact some very sophisticated AI designed to save money at universities by replacing philosophy professors with computers and if it presented sufficient evidence, I'd have to reconsider (d).  And if I didn't, I'd violate (c).  \nAm I a skeptic, therefore?  By no means!  But I do find skepticism to be a useful tool for combating misplaced certainty.\n"}]}

That a position would be \"correct\" doesn't make linguistic sense; it can be \"defensible\" and perhaps \"the most rational to take\", but \"correct\" implies that there are \"right answers\" in philosophy and the universe.\nNext, when we speak of skepticism we must also talk about the scientific epistemological base, as those who subscribe to the former most likely will subscribe to the latter. Namely: a true philosophical skeptic would most likely not hold that their position is the \"correct one to hold\", but rather that it exhibits the most convincing evidence of being the most rational framework and therefore it is the position they take.\nDoes skepticism exhibit the most convincing evidence of being the most rational framework? I personally believe that it does. Physicalism asserts the possibility that the \"self-aware entity\" and consciousness itself are actually illusions, and we are just matter and energy. Seeing as this is not impossible (there exist no arguments definitively eliminating that possibility, and even if there were, it is possible they are flawed), we are faced with the possibility of a totally material universe with no supernatural or special entities like the self or consciousness.

If you want to call an ingenious method that no-one else anticipated a 'trick' then so be it - but it is in no way cheap. Let's review what G\u00f6del proved in his two so-called incompleteness theorems. I will state the theorems informally but note that every single term in the statement has a formal and perfectly determinate counterpart:\n\nG\u00f6del's First Incompleteness Theorem (G1T) Any sufficiently strong formalized system of basic arithmetic contains a statement G that can neither be proved or disproved by that system.\nG\u00f6del's Second Incompleteness Theorem (G2T) If a formalized system of basic arithmetic is consistent then it cannot prove its own consistency.\n\nNow, as I see it, you are asking two questions:\n\nAre these theorems 'serious arguments'?\nDo they propel philosophy forward?\n\nThe answer to both questions is yes. I answer them in turn:\n\nThe argument itself is metamathematical which means that it employs a meta-language to prove things about the object language of ordinary mathematics.\nThe way G\u00f6del does this is he takes his metalanguage to be one that includes intuitive notions of arithmetic (the natural numbers) together with an understanding of what primitive recursive functions on the natural numbers are. Using this meta-language he proves that any formalization of basic arithmetic can capture its own provability relation. He first defines what is called a G\u00f6del numbering scheme in which every formula of the language in our formalization is assigned a unique number (in our metalanguage.)\nHe then proves that there is a formal one-place open formula NotProv(x) that can be interpreted to mean \"x is unprovable\" where x is a numeral in the formalization (remember that what is under consideration is a formal system of basic arithmetic so it will contain the equivalent of intuitive numbers, i.e. numerals) that correspond to a given sentence in the language via the G\u00f6del numbering.\nNow, given NotProv(x) we can do what G\u00f6del called a diagonalization, namely apply NotProv(x) to itself, i.e. take x to be the numeral corresponding to the formula NotProv(x). Call the resulting sentence G = NotProv(NotProv). And since NotProv(x) says that 'x is unprovable' you can see that G says 'I am unprovable'. And something that says it is unprovable cannot be proved nor disproved.\nThis is a very quick and informal way to present the argument - one would normally have to distinguish between the semantic and the syntactic versions of the theorem. But the point is that as you can see there is serious and rigorous work going on here.\nThe proof of (G2T) is similar. Using NotProv(x) you can define a 'consistency sentence' for your given formalization by writing NotProv(0=1), i.e a sentence that says 'No contradiction is provable' which is equivalent to 'This system is consistent.' And by a similar but more technically subtle argument you can argue that this sentence is unprovable, given that the system is in fact consistent.\n\nThe second theorem is arguably more epoch-making than the first because it spelled the end of Hilbert's Program. This is a major philosophical shift in the philosophy of mathematics, essentially spelling the end of the philosophical school of formalism.\nFurthermore, people have argued that (G1T) proves that we can never fully capture arithmetical truth because a further consequence of (G1T) is that the sentence G is actually true and hence we can conclude that any formalization of arithmetic will contain statements which we can see are true but which are not in fact provable in that system.\nThis has led people like Michael Dummett (an intuitionist) to label arithmetical truth as 'indefinitely extensible' (cf. Dummett 'The Philosophical Significance of Godel's Theorem'.) People like Lucas and Penrose have used both (G1T) and (G2T) to argue in favour of what is called an anti-mechanist thesis, i.e. that minds cannot be machines (cf. Penrose 'The Emperor's New Mind' and Lucas 'Minds, Machines and Godel'.)\n\n\nIn general, I have to say that the philosophical impact of both (G1T) and (G2T) cannot be overstated. They were events of monumental significance for analytic philosophy, for the philosophy and practice of mathematics as well as for theories of computation and machines. Most people (especially idiotic and ignorant continental postmodernists who have made it a sport to abuse mathematics in their pursuit of alternative vocabularies) fob them off as tricks because they have not bothered to look at the actual technical details involved and think that the idea of the proof gives them a perfect grasp of its implications. Popularizations don't really do the theorems justice.\nIf you are interested I recommend you go through the whole argument - the moment of revelation when it clicks together is as near an aesthetic experience as you're ever likely to have doing formal logic.\n"}]}

Keep in mind that I am not a mathematician so the answer will likely contain mistakes and I'm not committed to this view, but am interested in seeing the debate become a debate.  Further, my understanding of G\u00f6del's work comes largely from my reading of G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas Hofstadter.  As such, this may be a criticism of Hofstadter's  book rather than of G\u00f6del Incompleteness. Caveat lector!\nFirst, I accept its value in mathematics.  (How can I not?)  I will point out that G\u00f6del's work did seem to end the Principia Mathematica project, which might be what the article means by \"frighten[ing] mathematicians back in the thirties.\"  In addition, the Wikipedia article on Foundations of mathematics suggests that the incompleteness theorems have diverted mathematics from Hilbert's program of formalism:\n\nIn a sense, the crisis has not been resolved, but faded away: most mathematicians either do not work from axiomatic systems, or if they do, do not doubt the consistency of ZFC, generally their preferred axiomatic system. In most of mathematics as it is practiced, the various logical paradoxes never played a role anyway, and in those branches in which they do (such as logic and category theory), they may be avoided.\n\nSecond, I accept that the Theorems are, in fact, true.  For this I'm greatly indebted to GEB, which may be a popularization, but also produced in me something akin to an \"aesthetic experience\".  The remarkable idea that a formal system can be made to evaluate itself and that such a self-referential operation implies that the system will thereby be rendered incomplete took hold of me as I read and understood it.  Further, the concept seems inescapable, because it is.\nSo what we are left with is the application of G\u00f6del Incompleteness outside of mathematics.\nAnd the more that I think about it, the more that I think, \"So what?\"  Obviously it's of great help if you are in a dialog with someone who wants to create a complete, consistent, self-validating system of thought.  But as we are all postmodern in the chronological sense, that doesn't seem to be an issue all that often.  And of course G\u00f6del's work will be invaluable to those who are looking for the limits of Artificial Intellegence or who wonder if there is any mechanical model that can simulate a mind.\nWhen I try to make sense of the ideas in the context of the intellectual landscape, I feel like I'm waking from a beautiful dream.  It was profound and compelling when I was under its spell, but now I shake off drowsiness and wonder how the core idea is any different from the Epimenides paradox:\n\nThey fashioned a tomb for thee, O holy and high one\n  The Cretans, always liars, evil beasts, idle bellies!\n  But thou art not dead: thou livest and abidest forever,\n  For in thee we live and move and have our being.  \n\u2013 Epimenides, Cretica\n\nSurely, an interesting puzzle, but not really something upon which to build a philosophical argument upon.  Which makes me think that G\u00f6del is often cited by non-mathematicians because he's a famous mathematician with an umlaut in his name.  And that, I think we can all agree, would be a cheap trick.\n"}]}

It is comparatively easy to prove (see below) that the halting problem is undecidable, that is, there is no computable procedure that can reliably determine whether a given program/input pair will lead to a halting computation. Suppose now that T is a true theory with a computably axiomatizable list of axioms. If T were complete, then we could solve the halting problem in the following way: given program p and input x, we systematically search through all possible proofs from T of either the statement asserting that p does halt on x, or of the statement asserting that p does not halt on x. If T is true and complete, then we will eventually find such a proof on one side or the other. Thus, we will be able to say in finite time yes-or-no whether p halts on input x. This contradicts the undecidability of the halting problem. So T must not be complete after all. In other words, there will be true statements not provable in T. One can use the proof to show that there are such statements of the form, \"such-and-such program does not halt on such-and-such input.\"  The statement is true, in the sense that that program does not halt on that input, but we are unable to prove this statement in T. \nThis proof of the incompleteness theorem allows one to dispense with the usual arguments via the G\u00f6del-fixed point lemma, which can sometimes be confusing, and reveals the incompleteness theorem instead simply as a version of the halting problem. Indeed, many readers may believe that the self-referential aspects of the fixed-point lemma lay at the heart of the incompleteness phenomenon, but this proof seems completely to avoid self-reference (well, it confines the self-reference aspect to the proof of the undecidability of the halting problem itself). \nSo what was G\u00f6del's real achievement? Perhaps the most important idea that he had in his theorems was the arithmetization of syntax, the idea that assertions of number theory can be viewed as assertions about assertions. This idea is profound, and I used it above in the halting problem argument, in presuming that the assertion that a program halts or does not halt is expressible as a statement that might be proved or refuted in T. The arithmetization idea has now been woven completely into the modern perspective, as we all know that the philosophical articles that we write on our computer, as well as photos, music, videos and so on that we have there, are represented ultimately with zeros and ones inside the computer, and so it is an easy step for us to think of an article as really a very long sequence of bits, essentially an enormous number. And this is the essence of arithmetization.\n\nProof that the halting problem is undecidable. If there were a computable procedure to reliably determine whether a given program/input halts, then design a new program q that on input p first asks whether p halts on input p, and then performs the opposite behavior itself. It now follows that q halts on input q if and only if it doesn't, a contradiction.\n"}]}

Paradox & antinomies have been used by serious philosophical thinkers, such as Hegel and Kant (in passing only) in the West; and by Nagarjuna and Daoism in the East.  \nGodels achievement, in context, is one part of the reinvigoration of formal logic since Frege, he introduced new techniques and questions into mathematical logic. However most popular expositions miss the importance of Paradox and tying it into the larger framework of Paradoxical thought in Philosophy - they settle for an exposition of Godels proof, whereas his main ideas are explicable in fairly simple terms - as they should be - and they do not give the larger & broader picture of Mathematical Logic: categorical Logic, intuitionist logic, inconsistent mathematics, paraconsistency and so on. \nThere is an incredible amount of verbiage about Godels Theorem, important  though it is, which should be contemplated alongside the incredible amount of verbiage around Deconstruction, important though that is.\nOne of the elements of Badious Programme is to prune back this verbiage & metaphysical idiocy by making mathematics the site of ontology. But one should note that his book Being & Event references the Event of Derrida in the paper he presented at Columbia University which was to consolidate Structuralism but actually became a springboard for Deconstruction.\nAlthough, Godels Theorem is presented usually as a death-knell of Mathematical Logicism, there has been found ways past it; certain parts of his programme has been completed. For example Gentzens proof of the consistency of PA, paraconsistent logic helps overcome contradictions in the rational architecture of mathematics by localising them. \nThere appears to be a general tendency towards Logical Pluralism which might be considered the outcome of the Logical Monism of Hilberts programme after a century of thought. \nSo far from Post-Modernism being inconsequential, one can see that the grand narrative of logical monism which may be seen as part of the modernist project has become Post-Modern by moving towards Logical Pluralism. Not the One but the Multiple.\n"}]}

Emotion, instinct, and biases often dominate the function of the mind and produce various type of irrational thought.\nAn oddity of the human mind is that when it considers its own thoughts, it usually finds a great deal to like and when it considers the thoughts of others, it often is skeptical.  I've found this can happen even when I'm in agreement with the thoughts of others!  (I believe the Ontological argument is valid and so does my friend.  But I think he might be wrong.)  We are often over-skeptical of the ideas of others and over-confident of our own ideas.\nSince every mind will be disrupted by a unique set of interference, one solution to the problem of knowing if an explanation is rational or not is to submit it to a collection of minds in some public forum (such as this one!) where it can be analyzed.  Presumably the consensus of many minds will eliminate the most common forms of bias.  Problems with this approach are left as an exercise for the reader!\nOften we work together to form a set of rules we agree on and can apply to validate our reasoning.  Remarkably, there are many overlaps between one set of rules and all other sets of rules.

An explanation (which by definition purports to be rational) can be irrational if it fails to satisfy the standard. To say that a given account of p which refers to a consideration is rational would be to say that p is justified by the consideration. \"Be rational!\" is a guiding principle which instructs you to follow the rules of logic or epistemology and to be maximally coherent.

Not merely illogical or nonsensical. It may be purely emotive. \"Because we MUST!\" It may take the form of a \"because\" and refer to a \"cause\" that is not falsifiable. \"Because I want it.\" It may even take the form of a chant. \"USA! USA! USA!\" Perhaps the most common form, which combines all these is the appeal to authority. \"Because... everyone does it, Aristotle proved it, God commands it, it was always thus, etc.\nAccording to the work of Walter Ong, Eric Havelock, and other classicists, this was the common form of knowledge transmission in oral society, specifically, the Homeric tradition. Values, codes, and knowledge had to be \"memorized\" in poetic form, commands,rhymes, and \"sayings,\" because that was the only way to store culture and pass it on. Much like our first interlocutions with children.\nThe prerequisite of \"reasoning,\" then, is writing. The shift from oral, Homeric culture to the Greek's unique phonetic alphabet turned words into preserved, visual objects, no longer actions and events in flux. Court oratory, proclamations, drama, histories, dialectic could all be \"written down\" like pinned specimens, preserved, examined, debated.\nThis \"visualizing\" of speech came alongside the visual demonstrations of geometry, where \"reasoning\" from common axioms was carried out visually with line and compass to \"show\" what follows from coherent \"ratios.\" Similar \"lines\" of proportional reasoning could be followed in the developing \"logoi\" of written arguments. (See Plato's Phaedrus for contemporary thoughts on the matter.)\nThis, anyway, is Havelock's thesis pertaining to the cultural trauma of alphabetized speech and the origins of Plato's \"rational\" attacks on the poets and Homeric tradition, with their appeals to heroism, authority, tradition, and other forms of \"irrational\" persuasion. I, for one, find it quite compelling and illuminating.\nSo, \"rational\" explanations are a type of rhetoric and persuasion. They appeal to commonly accepted axioms and a coherent development of \"ratios\" and symmetries, not unlike geometrical theorems. They may retain, but supersede, oral appeals to memorization, rhyme, emotion, authority. They may be deductive or inductive, factual or not.

According to Wikipedia, the Bront\u00eb family and Jane Austen wrote pseudonymously for that reason.\nThankfully, Wikipedia actually quotes the author himself on his reasons for using names other than his own:\n\n... As is well-known, my authorship has two parts: one pseudonymous and the other signed. The pseudonymous writers are poetic creations, poetically maintained so that everything they say is in character with their poetized individualized personalities; sometimes I have carefully explained in a signed preface my own interpretation of what the pseudonym said. Anyone with just a fragment of common sense will perceive that it would be ludicrously confusing to attribute to me everything the poetized characters say. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, I have expressly urged that anyone who quotes something from the pseudonyms will not attribute the quotation to me (see my postscript to Concluding Postscript). It is easy to see that anyone wanting to have a literary lark merely needs to take some verbatim quotations from \"The Seducer,\" then from Johannes Climacus, then from me, etc., print them together as if they were all my words, show how they contradict each other, and create a very chaotic impression, as if the author were a kind of lunatic. Hurrah! That can be done. In my opinion anyone who exploits the poetic in me by quoting the writings in a confusing way is more or less a charlatan or a literary toper.\n\nTo me, that indicates that Kierkegaard himself preferred to think of his pseudonyms as separate individuals as if they were characters in a novel rather than alternative representations of himself.

The first part of Three Upbuilding Discourses is about (at least in part) how love does not depend on external circumstances, but rather on one's internal state.  The movement described in Fear and Trembling from being aesthetically determined to being a knight of infinite resignation to being a knight of faith is precisely the movement by which a person comes to live as though the claim that love does not depend on external circumstances is true.  The love of the aesthetic person depends entirely on external circumstances; the love of the knight of infinite resignation is partly spiritual and internal, but also partly external (in a different way) and so they despair; and the love of the knight of faith is internal and spiritual.\nThis is just one of many such parallels between the pseudonymous works and the signed works.

That means body-body interaction, that means mind-on-body and body-on-mind interaction, and that means causal activity within one's mind. All of that has God as its true cause. Nothing created has any real causal power, which means that what look like causes in the order of nature are really just 'occasions' for God to do causal work.\nNow, this raises a huge problem when it comes to human free will and sin. For example, if my decision to commit murder is caused by God, then it seems that God is the one responsible for the murder, not me. If I have no causal power of my own, in what sense can I even be considered an agent? People disagree on how Malebranche solved this problem. I think his solution (see Elucidation One of his Search after Truth) was to say that we have a purely negative power over our will: when faced with a false good that nevertheless appears good to us, we can either give consent to it (pausing our perpetual search for good and stopping with this particular good) or decline to give consent (continuing our perpetual search for good), and either way we do not bring about anything real in ourselves. Thus God is still the cause of everything real, and we only bring about something more like an absence or privation. This is obviously very similar to Augustine's way of handling God as the cause of evil.\nIn any case, Berkeley wanted no part of this. Even though he was enormously influenced by Malebranche, and agreed that inanimate nature has no causal power of its own (after all, mere ideas are purely passive and thus have no causal power), he wanted to preserve human freedom. So Berkeley's 'occasionalism' was a limited one, depriving inanimate nature of causal power, but allowing all spirits (God and humans alike) to have causal power of their own.\n"}]}

It was Hume who was hiding in the woods, ready to spring upon the unwary intellectual traveller with his 'profound' reasoning.

This is precisely what followers of Descartes had done. Following his master, Hume uncritically decides that all our mental notions are 'either ideas of sensation, or ideas of reflection' and that this beginning is the proper philosophical procedure. \n\nThat comes from an article entitled \"Hume, Reid and Skepticism\", written by Floyd Centore.

(Actual quote a bit longer: \"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\")\nAs to the actual question, how the philosophy of war has changed, I can only offer my own opinions, as I don't know of any modern book on the philosophy of war and in any case I would suspect it has changed quite a lot during the last half-century so books may be outdated. :-)\nSun Tze makes recommendations on when you can gain from war. These recommendations made sense in a relatively low-tech society. 2000 years ago a ruler needed not only the economic gains you can get from trade, but also the resources and manpower to defend himself, which required a large area any many people to rule over. \nToday, both as a result of the improved trade gains you can get from todays fast and global transportation, the developments in sanitation and health care that makes cities of millions possible, and as a result of the developments in weaponry that makes war a slaughterhouse, it is no longer possible to gain economically from making war. Trade will always be a better option than war, and you no longer need to rule over large areas to rule over many. \nThe reasons of war have therefore changed, and is now no longer about gaining economic advantages. Except for defense, war is now only waged either to fight injustices or gaining political advantages by looking like you fight injustices. So this has changed.\nSun Tze also, again reasonably from the ancient viewpoint, recommend that you pillage your enemy. \"One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own.\" This philosophy changed when it was clear that crushing and punishing Germany after the War only had negative outcomes. Instead armies today have orders to treat the local population well, and after winning a war the victor is seen to have not only the moral obligation to help rebuild the country, but also an obligation to make friends with the enemy to build on future close relations to prevent future war and increase future trade. \nThere may be more examples, but this IMO are two examples of how the Philosophy of war has changed.\n"}]}

The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and \n    kept.\n\nHowever, if you fete out the chariots, there are the abstract notion of rewarding soldiers, symbolic flag gestures, and how to treat captured enemies; all are still relevant in modern warfare.\nSome are also outdated due to technological advances, sieging a walled city has been much easier since the invention of cannons and modern missiles makes sieges more reasonable than ever:\nChapter 3.\n4. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. \n   The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of \n   war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over \n   against the walls will take three months more.\n\nSome are less relevant now that the primary means of warfare is no longer foot soldiers/infantries. But infantries still are an important part of modern warfare.\nChapter 6.\n1. Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the \n   enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has \n   to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.\n\nWe can't just send a bunch of missiles and hope to win the war.\nOn the other hand, some strategems are becoming even more important in modern warfare:\nChapter 13.\n4. Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and \n   conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.\n5. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be \n   obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.\n6. Knowledge of the enemy\u2019s dispositions can only be obtained from other men.\n\nSpying plays a much more important roles in modern warfare than it ever were.\nSun Tzu recognizes the importance of being able to read the \"ground\" and how to best handle them:\nChapter 11.\n46. Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose. \n    On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts \n    of my army.\n47. On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.\n48. On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses. On ground of \n    intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.\n49. On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies. On \n    difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.\n50. On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat. On desperate ground, I \n    would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives.\n\nWhile some values might have changed since the time of Sun Tzu, there are many general directions that are ageless.\n"}]}

For centuries, it has been regarded as the definite reading for military strategists, enthusiasts, and warriors of all nature.\nIt's readings have been taken and adapted to seemingly unrelated fields, such as business, and has influenced great leaders and military men such as Napoleon Bonaparte and General Douglas MacArthur.\nMy question is this: Since being written in ancient China, there have been many important advances in the technology of war, such as the invention of gunpowder, as well as many important militaristic events that may have influenced the world's views on war, such as the Mongol invasion and World War II.

Chances are, there's a reason that these people didn't just take a formal philosophy class, and I'd almost be willing to bet that these textbooks are part of the reason. Not that they're bad, per se, but certainly dry.\nBut honestly, my experience tells me that the best way to get involved in any field of study is to just throw yourself into it and start trying to learn as much as you can about it. Too much hand-wringing isn't going to do any good, and fretting about how much there [potentially] is that you won't understand is a waste of time. Yes, there will be plenty of things you won't understand. But that's true for all of us when we started. Read the texts you can get your hands on anyway, and absorb the parts that you do understand. You can always come back later once you've further developed your knowledge to pick up the parts you missed.\nAnd to that end, there's no book that I can recommend more highly than Will Durant's The Story of Philosophy. It's sort of like a combination anthology and introductory textbook, but it reads like neither of those things, which is a big win in my book.\nAs far as the \"friendly\" or \"accessible\" guideline, I've long recommended this book to high school freshmen.\nMore importantly, Durant attempts to show the interconnection of these philosophical ideas, in addition to presenting each as a separate case. The emphasis is placed on how the earlier philosopher's ideas informed the later philosophers, which is both undeniably true and undeniably useful. It also does quite a lot to make the book an interesting read.\nAnd understanding what came before is absolutely crucial to jumping into the field of philosophy. As much interesting stuff as goes on in contemporary philosophy, all of it is based or premised on the work of people who came before. If you don't have at least some basic understanding of the field, it will be next to impossible to keep your head above water reading the works of contemporary philosophers, even though they might refrain from using such words as \"thou\" or \"thine\".\nLike it or not, philosophy is a decidedly academic discipline, where it's become accepted practice (and some would go so far as to argue necessary) to dress up your thoughts in dense, oddly-worded prose in order for it to be accepted by the \"community\". That and academics are writing for a far different audience than the rest of the world. In particular, they're writing for each other. They can (and do!) make a lot of assumptions about what the reader is supposed to know, throwing around concepts as if you were as familiar with them as they themselves are. This is quite unlikely for most of us, of course, even fellow academics.\n"}]}

Almost certainly, time spent reading these will be better repaid than is time spent reading contemporary introductions. From there, follow up an issue of interest in the texts by consulting something like The Cambridge Companion to X and this will give a way in to some of the contemporary debates about that historical text.\n"}]}

Contemporary philosophy, to me, not only is a heterogeneous category, but also defies any easy generalization. I would loosely define it as any kind of philosophy (continental, analytic, orthodox, heterodox, occidental, oriental, psychoanalytic, etc.) put forth in the last 100 years or so. \nAlso, Mr. Weissman did not specify as to what school of philosophy (I know it is a futile dichotomy, but I cannot restrain myself from making the analytic-continental distinction, especially because the question concerns contemporary philosophy). However, from the context of his question (e.g. \"\"big thought\" is once again everywhere\"), I hereto presumptuously assume that he had in mind a specific offshoot of contemporary philosophy: namely, the politico-ideological school, most closely associated with the works of \"continental\" philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Louis Althusser, Alain Badiou, Carl Schmitt, etc. You get the idea.\n[[So, if you think that I totally misconstrued the question, you can ignore this.]]\nI want to first challenge Mr. Weissman's view that there exists an accessible primary text in contemporary philosophy. I can already hear the moans and tribulations of students who are trying to get through even the easiest text (text, not seminar) by Derrida or Deleuze (I'm not even going to Lacan). Okay. I'll say it. \nContemporary philosophy is difficult.\nAnd if this is a surprise, I will remind you of the simplest fact that virtually every discipline (mathematics, physics, literature, you name it) has become increasingly and radically more difficult, specialized and professionalized in the twentieth century. Philosophy is no exception. Although Kant and Hegel are indeed impenetrable to an ordinary Joe, reading Jacques Ranci\u00e8re and Fredric Jameson is nothing like it (some might argue that Hegel is the ultimate philosopher of impenetrability, but that's another topic of discussion). \nI guess what I'm trying to say is, to paraphrase Robespierre (as \u017di\u017eek would), you want an introduction without introduction. I think that introductions are necessary for first-timers. However, since Mr. Weissman insists, I will try my best to provide him with one. My best shot would be:\nSlavoj \u017di\u017eek\nOkay. You know the guy; you've heard of the guy. I really think \u017di\u017eek's books are the most eclectic--in the sense that they incorporate almost all contemporary philosophical ideas (Giorgio Agamben, Badiou...). And his writing style is also riveting, which helps. The more accessible books could be:\n\nThe Sublime Object of Ideology\nHow to Read Lacan\nWelcome to the Desert of the Real\nLooking Awry\n\nAnd I know that Badiou's In Praise of Love and some of Foucault's writings and interviews of various philosophers are also very accessible, but they are not as comprehensive as most of \u017di\u017eek's works are.\nIf you are not yet convinced, \u017di\u017eek is funny. Literally.\n*P.S. Although the question did not ask for this, I'll answer it anyway. I recommend David West's Continental Philosophy: An Introduction because, yes, it is an introduction, but I sincerely believe that anyone who has no or very little familiarity with the contemporary thought would have a lot of troubles when trying to get through a primary text.\n"}]}

This is because the contemporary field is highly specialized and fragmented, and will get you lost. One very important reason not to is that one of the hallmarks of philosophy is to get you to think for yourself, and so it is essential to know the history and origins of ideas and where they come from, and why is it they are as they are now.\nFirst of all, Western Philosophy after Kant in the late 19th century broke up into various strands. \nAnalytic philosophy\nwas founded by Frege, Russell, von Quine and Wittgenstein, who emphasized a mathematical approach to philosophy. Their emphasis was on conceptual clarity, linguistic analysis and logical understanding. This led later to Logical Positivism and subsequently to current philosophy as it is now prevalent in Anglo-American universities.\nContinental philosophy\nincludes the field of Phenomenology (Later Existentialism); Hegelism, who exposed a form of Idealism (Marxism and Critical Theory arose as a reaction to this); Freud and Psychoanalytic Theory. Structuralism and Post-Structuralism is in part influenced by Wittgenstein.\n\nThe Whole and The Part\nWhy is it important to know how it all started and begin similarly yourself? Because in the realm of philosophical inquiry, there generally may be what is considered the 'Whole' and 'Part'. It is better to start off with the whole so you can firstly, try to figure out the problems for yourself, and identify what questions concern you the most. Is it the quandary of existence? The idea of a purpose? The question of an ideal society?\nMost, probably all philosophy starts off with such questions as relates to our life and existence, relating to us as we are and our mortality. It starts off as speculation and wonder about the nature of things. It is only in the last 2 centuries that philosophy became mathematical and linguistic in nature - partly influenced by the scientific age and its insistence of empirical certainty, partly as a result of a dissatisfaction with vague metaphysical concepts. Modern philosophy tilted towards the material world, in one way or another. \nLinguistic analysis\narose as result for our need for clarification in order to understand the underlying meaning behind words so as to understand what we are talking about, that is also an offshoot of the scientific age.\n\nIt is not clear however that the answers are to found as we become clearer, or if there is even such a thing as an 'answer' at all. A large part of analytic philosophy, influenced by Wittgenstein, accepts the role of philosophy as simply conceptual clarity. A large part of Continental philosophy rejects that. A good part of both strides both sides. The question remains nevertheless whether the role of philosophy is merely to clarify, or to find specific answers. Normative questions continue to remain important to us, philosopher or not.\nGood references\n\nStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Written by experts in their fields and refereed. Some are quite technical. Heavily analytic but adding a lot of continental topics.\nEarly Modern Texts. Many ancient and modern philosophy Works translated with erudition and adherence to the original by Jonathan Bennett, an Oxford philosopher.\nContemporary Debates in Philosophy series. Very good series showing both sides of the arguments of philosophical topics, written with clarity and clear explanation. You can actually find some of them free on Google. \n\nNote about Reading Original Texts\nIf you acquaint yourself with the language written long before, the use of the words may be different, and have a different sense of meaning. Many of these texts however, have good translations. It is important to read them as they are so that you can get a good idea of what those philosophers are trying to convey, and as best as possible, what they mean in the way they say it. Likewise, to get a feel of the concerns of those philosophers in their own time in the way they convey their thoughts to you through their style and language. \n"}]}

I want to recommend two books.\n\nScott Soames. 2005. Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, 2 vols, Princeton University Press This book is based upon a two semester graduate class in the history of analytic philosophy that Soames has taught at Princeton for years. It's widely recognized as the best secondary source on the history of analytic philosophy out there because it is lucid and readable. It doesn't require much in the way of technical logical apparatus, so it is very accessible to most readers. The text has a couple of important deficiencies, but they are all sins of omission. He doesn't discuss Frege at all, which is peculiar and he tends to focus on issues in philosophy of language (Soames's speciality) and sometimes give less attention to important developments in other areas, such as ethics. Nevertheless, Soames's book is tremendously useful: use it as your guidebook, reading along with the other readings below. \nA. P. Martinich, et al, Analytic Philosophy: An Anthology, Blackwell is a good anthology that contains most of the really important papers in the history of analytic philosophy. Analytic philosophy is much more an article field than a book field, so if you want to get up to speed you should really check out these articles.\n\nOnce you have Soames and Martinich under your belt you're probably ready to dive into which ever topic or field in analytic philosophy you want. So, say you read through these and find that you really want to go deeper in Epistemology. Then I would suggest that you look around on the philosophy department websites at a couple of really good philosophy departments (NYU, Rutgers, MIT, Princeton, Michigan, Harvard, Pitt, Yale) and see if you can syllabi in classes that interest you. Just start reading the stuff listed on the syllabus. That's how you get up to speed on the state of the art in a subfield today. \n"}]}

He famously decrees that:\n\nThe greatest violation of a human being\u2019s duty to himself regarded merely as a moral being (the humanity in his own person) is the contrary of truthfulness, lying. In the doctrine of right an intentional untruth is called a lie only if it violates another's right; but in ethics, where no authorization is derived from harmlessness, it is clear of itself that no intentional untruth in the expression of one's thoughts can refuse this harsh name. [ ... ] By an external lie a human being makes himself an object of contempt in the eyes of others; by an internal lie he does what is still worse: he makes himself contemptible in his own eyes and violates the dignity of humanity in his own person. [...] By a lie a human being throws away and, as it were, annihilates his dignity as a human being.\n(Kant, The Metaphysics of Morals, 1996, p 182)\n\nAs you observe, from a strictly Kantian point of view, there is absolutely no way that a lie can ever be justified. It is a complete violation of human agency, insofar as it manipulates someone (effectively treating them as a means rather than an end in and of themselves) into believing something for whatever reason. While it could be argued that the overall goal of the lie is a moral good, Kant would reject it a priori for its means, which he would consider sharply and incontestably immoral. That immorality outweighs and precludes any morality that might come later from the results of the action.\nThus, it makes absolutely no difference with respect to the morality of the original decision (i.e., whether or not to lie to the soldier) whether the eventual outcome of your decision is utter social chaos or collapse. That's an ends-based calculation, one that Kant says you can't possibly know at the time and shouldn't possibly matter when assessing the morality of one individual action.\nAt least one of the justifications that Kant would (and did) provide for this particular moral choice is that you are not responsible for the death of the two Jews, even if your telling the truth leads to their brutal murder by the Nazi soldiers. The consequence may be undeniably horrible, but it wasn't your crime and you weren't directly responsible for its execution. Essentially, he's saying, \"that's on them, not you.\"\nHowever, if you lie, you now take ownership and responsibility in the atrocity. Or, in other words, you become morally culpable for the immoral actions of the Nazi soldiers because you are essentially manipulating the soldiers yourself through your decision to lie and distort the truth. And once you've made the choice to distort the truth, you've established control over the situation and you should be held responsible for whatever immoral outcome may result. This is the infamous causing versus allowing distinction.\nAll of that to say that this is really not a contradiction or dilemma for a strict Kantian. Of course, that hardly means that it fails to be one for most of us, who take a far less extremist view of morality.\n\nIt's also worth considering that a neo-Kantian would take issue with your example on technical level, arguing that it's not a good example because the Holocaust is an exceptional situation, a special case, if you will.\nMore specifically, the German state at the time formed an illegitimate government, and the SS officers were acting as agents of this illegitimate government, this state that is on face unjust. Given such case, one could argue, his entire corpus of ethics does not apply, as it was only intended to apply to situations involving a just government. (For more on this, see Kant's \"Doctrine of Right\" and Metaphysics of Morals 6:264, etc.)\n\nFinally, if a Kantian discussion of this exact question interests you, you might find this recently-published article to be a worthwhile read. \n"}]}

Or, if he didn't, how could it be solved hypothetically?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While the question is an interesting one, there are several issues at hand to consider. First, the question seems premised on the belief that there can be multiple categorical imperatives. This is not Kant's view of the matter. For Kant, there can be multiple hypothetical imperatives but only one categorical imperative (not all contemporary Kantians agree). Hypothetical imperatives derive from either the goal of happiness (to be happy you need to eat) or the desire to accomplish some task (To make bread, you need yeast). But the Categorical Imperative follows from the dictates of reason. \nI next want to look at this paragraph in your question:\n\nBoth imperatives can be supported if I ask myself the question \"what if everyone did it?\". If everyone lied whenever they felt like it, society and civilization would collapse. Therefore I must never lie. But society would be a grim, inhumane place if everyone cooperated in killing the innocent. Therefore I must never betray those under my protection.\n\nThis paragraph has several interesting features. First, there's a misunderstanding of how the categorical imperative works. Second, there is an important slippage in the language between the two universalizations.\nOn the first point, I will limit my remarks to the universalization model of the Categorical Imperative. The question is not \"what if everyone did it?\" but rather what if it was always to happen or in a possibly more loose way \"what if it became a law of nature?\" Moreover, the problem that is supposed to raise is not necessarily about societal collapse but about contradictions in implementation (I will always tell lies is a system that no longer works when every rational creature is always telling lies -- regardless of social consequences it eliminates the meaning of its own criterion.)\nSecond, the characterization of telling the man at the door about the people you are hiding is problematic. Specifically, when it is described as \"cooperat[ing] in killing the innocent.\" This cannot possibly be an expression of the categorical imperative. But this is also not what Kant expects of the agent. Instead, Kant expects the agent to cooperate with the request of a seemingly rational agent (this distinction is crucial to Korsgaard's modification of Kant's answer). On Kant's account, we must assume the requests we receive from other humans no matter how unreasonable are founded on reason. In other words, despite the blood on the axe, we have to assume they are asking -- not to engage in the immoral act of killing the innocent but for some other reason.\nThus, for Kant, there's no conflict between these two ideas. In some ways, this makes things worse -- because it undermines one of the better outs we have on the picture where we cannot lie. To some extent, Kant gives us a positive duty to tell the truth to other rational beings -- not merely a negative duty not to lie. If we look in the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant does seem to have little leeway in suggesting we needn't purposelessly express the truth.\n"}]}

However, I personally believe solipsism is bordering on incoherence and egoism, and exploring what it would really mean if all of existence as we know it was solely for us or perceived by us may help demonstrate that.  Two possibilities arise:\n1: The universe is some sort of simulation or model, all beings we perceive are merely agents of that system, and we are the sole target of the simulation.  All of existence, therefore, is created for our benefit.  We must then ask, why?  Why are we so special as to merit all of this?  And furthermore how?  How, despite being special, are so many millions of mindless agents able to function in a way that I am unable to distinguish them from myself?\n2: The universe exists largely as we are taught in school, the big bang, atoms, molecules, evolution, and the whole shebang, and yet we are the only being that actually experiences or \"lives\" - we are the only being with a mind.  This should similarly raise some alarming questions, why do we have this ability, and yet all others do not?  And again, how is it possible that we are so fundamentally and critically different from all other beings in the universe, and yet we cannot identify a difference?\nTo me, both cases seem highly implausible.  Unprovable, but does it not seem very strange to think that either of these situations are how existence \"really is\"?   Personally, the alternatives, that either 1: we are part of a simulation or other matter-less existence (like Berkeley's idealism) wherein the beings we perceive as similar to us are in fact thinking minds like us, or 2: the physical world exists largely as we understand it, and therefore again, things we perceive like us have reasonably similar mental states.\nThis is somewhat related to the philosophical theory of Functionalism, which could be vulgarly summarized as \"if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then it's a duck!\" which might be a more robust response to solipsism than most other philosophies.\nAnd, now that I've discussed why I think solipsism is bunk, let me share with you this wonderful short story, The Egg, it's a beautiful perspective on solipsism, and no matter how many times I read it, I get chills and a little smile every time I get to the end.

Most of us believe that we aren't dreaming, that when things are hidden behind obstacles they are still there, and that the sun will rise again tomorrow. Most of us also believe that other minds exist.\nThis series of assumptions turns out to be a really useful model for understanding and predicting our environment, and modifying our behaviour to meet our ends.\nThe fact that these cannot be proven, does not mean that they are false, or that it would be beneficial to consider them false.\nOne can say that they are not sure, and indeed, some versions of solipsism state simply that the only mind's existence the individual is sure of is their own. This really doesn't go very far, as at this level of scepticism, there's very little to be sure of at all - maybe each 'instant' we're recreated in a totally new world with a different history, and our memories and identities are fabricated.\nI think the reason solipsism seems more important to argue against than a disbelief in e.g. object constancy is rooted in our conception of 'the ghost in the machine' and the mind-body problem. We're rather self-centred.\nSome background and historical arguments:\nSolipsism is a world view extrapolated from the problem of other minds. Simply stated, the problem of other minds is that we cannot know (or prove) that others have minds like our own.\nThe Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy has an in-depth article about it. It presents a series of solutions to the problem (and by extension, to solipsism). The following is the uncomfortable conclusion:\n\nThis article has been almost entirely\n  concerned with the epistemological\n  problem of other minds. What generates\n  the problem has been carefully\n  delineated. The standard solutions\n  have been outlined and the various\n  critical responses discussed. What is\n  clear is that there does not seem to\n  be what might be called a received\n  solution to the problem. It has been\n  argued that the problem cannot be\n  removed, nor can it be made easier to\n  solve, by embracing any particular\n  philosophy of mind.\n\n"}]}

It's pure demagoguery to assert that one cannot disprove solipsism therefore the empirical universe exist only as the figment of the imagination of the person making the claim. \nDescription: Demanding that one proves the non-existence of something in place of providing adequate evidence for the existence of that something.  Although it may be possible to prove non-existence in special situations, such as showing that a container does not contain certain items, one cannot prove universal or absolute non-existence.  The proof of existence must come from those who make the claims.\nLogical Form:\nI cannot prove that X exists, so you prove that it doesn\u2019t.\nIf you can\u2019t, X exists.\nExample #1:\nGod exists.  Until you can prove otherwise, I will continue to believe that he does.\nExplanation: There are decent reasons to believe in the existence of God, but, \u201cbecause the existence of God cannot be disproven\u201d, is not one of them.\nExample #2:\nSheila: I know Elvis\u2019 ghost is visiting me in my dreams.\nRon: Yeah, I don\u2019t think that really is his ghost.\nSheila: Prove that it\u2019s not!\nExplanation: Once again we are dealing with confusion of probability and possibility.  The inability to, \u201cprove\u201d, in any sense of the word, that the ghost of Elvis is not visiting Sheila in her dreams is an impossible request because there is no test that proves the existence and presence of a ghost, so no way to prove the negative or the non-existence.  It is up to Sheila to provide proof of this claim, or at least acknowledge that actually being visited by Elvis\u2019 ghost is just a possibility, no matter how slim that possibility is.\nException: If Ron were to say, \u201cThat is impossible\u201d, \u201cthere is no way you are being visited\u201d, or make some other claim that rules out any possibility no matter how remote (or crazy), then Sheila would be in the right to ask him for proof -- as long as she is making a point that he cannot know that for certain, and not actually expecting him to produce proof.\nTip: If you think you are being visited by aliens, gods, spirits, ghosts, or any other magical beings, just ask them for information that you can verify, specifically with a neutral third-party that would prove their existence.  This would be simple for any advanced alien race, any god or heavenly being.

It suggests that there is a theory which could conceivably be true of all minds, but of course there isn't. A solipsist mind believes there is no other mind, and therefore no other mind to convince that there is no other minds. He or she has no motivation to convince anyone because he believes there is no one else, and therefore no one to convince.\nThus, all that there might be is a solipsist person, a person believing that his or her mind is the only thing that exists and that the whole of reality is just an idea inside this unique mind. Assuming such a person really exists, he or she is not going to possibly convince anyone that they are mere fictional characters inside his or her mind. So, essentially, there is no argument to be had.\nSomething else is to say that a mind does not actually know anything outside itself, and can therefore only believe that there is a real world outside itself. As such, this does not say that a mind does not believe that there are other minds. Indeed, this seems to be what all minds believe. This theory, however, does explain how it might be possible to be a solipsist, since if it is possible to believe there is a world outside your mind and other minds with it, it must be possible to believe that there is no world outside and no other minds. If a mind knew other minds, or knew that there are other minds, it would be impossible for it to believe it is alone and to be a solipsist. Still, while it cannot be excluded that there exist solipsists people, it is unclear that anyone could actually live a life as a solipsist.\nThe idea that there may be solipsist people seems to have been offered as a way to help us think about the epistemological status of our own mind. this idea does not need to be falsified, it only needs to be pondered.\n"}]}

More recently, he has published another pair of article collections, The Engaged Intellect and Having the World in View, which reflect among other things his renewed interest in the philosophy of Wilfrid Sellars.\n"}]}

(Another answer points out that some religious traditions would reject that second assumption.) There seems to me to be no incompatibility in these two assumptions.\nLet me take your various points in turn:\n\nSince the languages are human inventions, that means that humans predate the books.\n\nYes, it would. But, I don't see how that in itself poses a problem for the claim that a given text has a divine origin. If one thinks of God (or the gods) as intervening in human affairs, one could happily say that human language developed and at some point God chose to communicate to the humans, doing so in the language that they had developed. It seems no different than how I can communicate with a Parisian even though French existed before I did and before I ever formed the intention to convey a message.\n\nLanguages, in general are not complete, so it's pretty convenient that whatever these books want to say fits in the languages.\n\nI am not sure what you intend by saying that \"languages are not complete.\" I'll interpret that as saying that there might well be messages that one would wish to convey that a given language does not provide the resources to convey. On that understanding, there also seems no problem here. If I convey a message to you in French, necessarily, the message that I do convey must be conveyable in French. If (not that I think that this is the case) there were some content that I wished to convey which English could express and French could not, it wouldn't be possible for me to convey the entire message that I wished to convey. It isn't \"convenient\" that what I do convey is expressible in French; it is a necessary consequence of my selecting French as the vehicle of communication.\nIt could well be that God might have wished to convey a message to us in a human language where that message was not expressible in the human language. That seems little different than the cases that arise when you speak to young children or adults who are not fluent in the language that you are communicating in---you select a sub-language of the language you are speaking, picked so as to be understandable to your audience. Sometimes, in so doing, you lose the ability to say that which you would like to say.\n\nSince the languages change over time, this means that the meaning of these books also changes over time(which the books deny).\n\nThis also seems no particular problem. The meanings of words in a language do alter over time, yes. That means if I read a letter written in English in 1500, and interpret it according to the prevailing meanings of its words in the English of 2011, I will likely misconstrue the writer's meaning. But, all is not lost. I can instead interpret the letter according to the meanings of its terms that prevailed in the English of 1500 (as best as I can discover them). Not having anything quite so good as the Oxford English Dictionary for many of the languages in which various religious texts are written, the problem might be harder to resolve in those cases. But, unsurprisingly, there is a great deal of scholarship on the languages in which those texts are written.\nSo, while \"text of divine origin\" is not one of my concepts, I don't see that any of the considerations that you have pointed to pose any particular problems for the claim that this or that text has a divine origin.\n"}]}

Does so much moral weight really turn on sound coming out of your mouth?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The early works\nKant gives multiple explanations for why lying is wrong and these accounts differ. In Kant's earlier works, Kant gives several different arguments against lying. Arguably the first in the Groundwork occurs before he even articulates the \"Categorical Imperative\" when discussing actions, he considers why a shopkeeper should be honest. Kant dismisses the idea that he should be honest just because it's good business.\nMoving forward, Kant gives two reasons that parallel articulations of the categorical imperative:\nVersion 1: Contradiction in thought\nIn his Groundwork, Kant's first argument is that when I think of lying as being a universal necessity (thinking my maxim to lie as a universal law according to the Categorical Imperative), the thought contradicts itself as I am dependent on others to believe my lie in order to have my maxim work but when I test it through the Categorical Imperative, I become aware that when it was a general law to lie if it fits myself, no one would believe my words:\n\nI soon become aware that I could indeed Will the lie, but by no means a\n  universal laW to lie; for according to such a laW there Would actually be\n  no promise at all, since it Would be futile to pretend my Will to others With\n  regard to my future actions, Who Would not believe this pretence;... (Ak. 4:403)\n\nThe same argument is reiterated in regard to false promising, which is equated with lying before (Ak. 4:419 and 4:424):\n\nwhen it is said that you ought not to make deceitful promises; and one assumes that the necessity of\n  this omission is not merely giving counsel for avoiding some other ill, so\n  that what is said would be: you ought not to make lying promises lest\nthe universality of a law that everyone, once he believes him\n  self to be in need, could promise Whatever he fancies With the intention\n  not to keep it, would make the promise and the end one may pursue\n  With it itself impossible, as no one would believe he was being promised\n  anything, but would laugh about any such utterance, as a vain pretence.\n\nThis is what he calls afterward \"contradiction in thought\" (Ak. 4: 424). Although this is a nice argument, it is totally unclear how to handle cases of a lie by omission here. Therefore, we have to go further.\nVersion 2: Violation of the humanity of others\nAnother argument, which I highlight because it is parallel but different from his later arguments, is the claim that it is wrong because it does not respect rationality in others. And this specifically relates to telling lies rather than omitting information. On his most basic picture, people are to be conceived of as rational and good even if empirical evidence says otherwise. (Conversely, we know that we ourselves are evil in his view). Here, Kant argues with the formula of humanity (Ak. 4:429):\n\nSo act that you use humanity, in\n  your own person as well as in the person of any other, always at the same time\n  as an end, never merely as a means. \n\nWhen discussing again the example of false promising, he argues that it would violate the ultimate value they represent (dignity) by virtue of sharing the faculty of reason, i.e. rationality. It would use a rational being merely as means  to an end, i.e. instrumentalise them (Ak. 4:429):\n\nsomeone Who has it in mind to make a lying promise to others will\n  see at once that he wants to make use of another human being merely\n  as a means, Who does not at the same time contain in himself the end.\n\nAn omission also seems capable of leading someone to miscalculate, but the trick is that one would not necessarily be merely the means of the person omitting informations. Instead, they could be acting carelessly on their own.\nA practical example might help here. Imagine evil-me and nice-you are standing outside of a building. We work as demolitions experts.\nScenario A\nnice-you: did all of the children leave the old orphanage so we can blow it up?\nevil-me:  yes.\nnice-you then blows up the orphanage. \nThis is my fault, because you acted on my information that it was safe.\n\nScenario B\nnice-you: did all of the children leave the old orphanage so we can blow it up?\nevil-me: I know all of them are out of the west wing [omitting that I know three kids are in the east wing].\nnice-you then blows up the orphanage.\nThis is on you, because my information did not indicate it was safe.\n\nThe Metaphysics of Morals\nKant in the Metaphysics of Morals: Doctrine of Virtue (not to be confused with the Groundwork) interestingly suggests a different reason why lying is wrong. Here, he suggests a violation of one's own rational nature. Because to tell a lie is to cease to behave rationally [1]. He also talks of \"truthfulness\" rather than \"telling the truth\", which in German (\"wahrhaftigkeit\") is destinct and is more in line with the latin quote included (Ak. 6:429):\n\nThe greatest violation of man's duty to himself regarded merely as a \n  moral being (the humanity in his own person) is the contrary of truth\n  fulness, lying (aliud lingua promptum, aliud pectore inclusum gerere*). [...] By a lie a man throws away and, as it were, annihilates his dignity as a man.\n*\"To have one thing shut up in the heart and another ready on the tongue.\" Sallust, \n  The War with Catiline X , 5 .\n\n[1] An important point here is that what Kant means by \"rational\" doesn't just mean \"behave reasonably\" but is linked a deeper idea of being a specific type of being that has a rational nature that is not defined by the phenomenological world\nNow, the case of carefully planned omissions isn't going to hinge on casuistical questions Kant considers in MPV. Kant seems to accept some. For instance, he accepts that in polite society, we don't have an obligation to tell people things like \"your face is ugly,\" but he doesn't address every type of circumstance.\nConclusion\nIt's clear we can on his view omit information in part because the duty is not to truth-telling simpliciter but to never mucking up my rationality or the rationality of others by providing misinformation.\nAt least since 1787, Kant distinguishes not between telling the truth and lying, but between truthfulness and lying (see 5:61). This is more in line with the argumentation he later carries on using (humanity) and is to some extend even explicit towards malicious omitting as being a form of lying in contrast to omitting things e.g. out of kindness.\n(We could also add further references from Kant's Lecture on Ethics that show how his view contrasted with earlier rationalist morality).\n"}]}

Standard histories saw the nineteenth-century medical treatment of madness (developed from the reforms of Pinel in France and the Tuke brothers in England) as an enlightened liberation of the mad from the ignorance and brutality of preceding ages. But, according to Foucault, the new idea that the mad were merely sick (\u201cmentally\u201d ill) and in need of medical treatment was not at all a clear improvement on earlier conceptions (e.g., the Renaissance idea that the mad were in contact with the mysterious forces of cosmic tragedy or the 17th-18th-century view of madness as a renouncing of reason). Moreover, he argued that the alleged scientific neutrality of modern medical treatments of insanity are in fact covers for controlling challenges to a conventional bourgeois morality. In short, Foucault argued that what was presented as an objective, incontrovertible scientific discovery (that madness is mental illness) was in fact the product of eminently questionable social and ethical commitments.\n\nThe Wikipedia entry on Foucault describes Madness and Civilization, a notable translation of an abridged version of the same work, in the following way:\n\nFoucault begins his history in the Middle Ages, noting the social and physical exclusion of lepers.[29] He argues that with the gradual disappearance of leprosy, madness came to occupy this excluded position. The ship of fools in the 15th century is a literary version of one such exclusionary practice, namely that of sending mad people away in ships. In 17th century Europe, in a movement Foucault famously calls the \"Great Confinement,\" \"unreasonable\" members of the population were institutionalised.[30] In the 18th century, madness came to be seen as the reverse of Reason, and, finally, in the 19th century as mental illness.\n  Foucault also argues that madness was silenced by Reason, losing its power to signify the limits of social order and to point to the truth. He examines the rise of scientific and \"humanitarian\" treatments of the insane, notably at the hands of Philippe Pinel and Samuel Tuke who he suggests started the conceptualization of madness as 'mental illness'. He claims that these new treatments were in fact no less controlling than previous methods. Pinel's treatment of the mad amounted to an extended aversion therapy, including such treatments as freezing showers and use of a straitjacket. In Foucault's view, this treatment amounted to repeated brutality until the pattern of judgment and punishment was internalized by the patient.\n\n"}]}

Instead, he says that such relations of power are everywhere and unavoidable.\nSo if biopower is truly inevitable, what are we supposed to do? Foucault is largely silent on that point. He seems to disregard the possibility of alternatives altogether.\nThe best you get is found in the collection of lectures entitled Society Must Be Defended, where he specifically advocates the use of a genealogical analysis of history to confront systems of power. In other places, he haphazardly seems to advocate \"resistance\", but that's never particularly well-defined The idea is that the only possible alternative to disciplinary forms of power is to recognize the problem and where it's coming from: the end goal of his theories seems to be mere recognition.

In fact, he warns specifically that in setting up a new system (a post-alternative world) is particularly dangerous, because it allows the current system (the current structures of power) to assimilate the movement, blocking off any real chance of reform. He'd probably say that we can't, but many people find that answer quite unsatisfying.\nThere are lots of possibilities proposed by post-Foucauldian scholars, but that would take another entire answer to even brush the surface. The dangers of \"labeling\" is a fundamental topic throughout critical theory, taken up by an absolutely dizzying array of people, all with their own unique brand of Foucault-inspired resistance. But if you're particularly interested in applying Foucauldian thought to psychiatry, I strongly recommend investigating the works of Thomas Szasz. \n"}]}

Below is an extended response written to address the question \"Does madness have an essence, which is expressed in individuals regardless of their culture and historical period? Answer with reference to Foucault\u2019s work on the history of madness.\" It is from a paper I wrote for a unit on Foucault last year. I'm not sure of people's views on posting things like this, but it contains the most comprehensive explanation I can give of why madness was not merely a label to Foucault. References are to the abridged version translated by R. Howard. \nIt is the thesis of this paper that Madness and Civilisation does not show that there is an essence of madness which exists a-historically and a-culturally. Instead the book shows how different ways of engaging with madness have, as their most significant commonality, functioned to transform it into a silent phenomenon. This commonality persists through time relationally in dynamic and historically localised networks of meaning, conditioned by the relation of reason to madness. The history conducted by Foucault unveils the process by which madness was forced first into a liminal social position, then to an exteriority; the movement of confining the mad and positioning madness as an Other in relation to reason. The truth of particular images of madness recounted from the classical age are neither affirmed nor discredited, and archival records are instead taken to be instantiations of the socio-historic context from which they emerge. Foucault named his project the archaeology of silence because it is a thesis of the book that madness endures in excess of the coordinates of reason. \nMadness persisted through time inside a complex of historically dynamic meanings masking it in concise formulations from the order of reason. After the time madness passed from a liminal experience to a pure exteriority, Foucault says it became \u201cthe D\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u00e0 of death\u201d (1961, p.13). Madness became a dimension of death already-present inside life. It was dissolved into the ether of non-identity through the opposition to meaning engendered by its exteriorisation from and objectification by reason; made into an \u2018already-present-death-in-life\u2019, a negativity or an \u201cabsence\u201d. The important point to retain in seeing the various forms through which madness passed is that \u201cmadness, if it is nothing, can manifest itself only by departing from itself, by assuming an appearance in the order of reason and thus becoming the contrary of itself\u201d (Foucault 1961:101). Each of the elaborate visions of madness in the classical age, despite their differences, functioned to silence madness by situating it inside a discourse whose positivity created, sustained and masked its relation to this absence. Foucault\u2019s ultimate formulation of madness is an answer to the difficulty of conveying the relation of a culture to the entity whose exclusion determined the possibility of its own truths.     \nFranz Fannon wrote of the decolonisation of Algeria that \u201cbeing colonized by a language has large implications for one\u2019s consciousness. \u2026It means, above all, to assume a culture, to support the weight of a civilization\u201d (1963: 91). In a similar vein Foucault writes that the phenomenon of madness is woven inside a \u201ctyrannical synthesis\u201d (1961, p.139) of myriad forces including morality, economics, religion, science and the ascendance of reason.  Foucault shows how the mind and body of the madmen, as well as the abstract categories of madness during the classical age, became sites upon which dispersed and changing lines of discursive power were operated, forcing the mad to assume the weight of the culture through which the categories of madness endured. Foucault shows that in classical age the locus for constructing the meaning of madness was not the mad, as would be the case in empiricism. Instead a networked and dynamic set of historically particular meanings as diverse as ethical responsibility, the relation between the mind body and soul, and human physiology, all came to inform protocols for engaging with madness. \nThe question of Madness and Civilisation concerns not only the permutations through which madness endured in time. The image of madness which comes to dominate the book has its foundational analogue in the practices of confinement which begin with the 18th century. According to Foucault the historical demarcation between madness and reason mirrors the material means through which madmen and women were exorcised from the social body, and forced to exist either exterior in isolation, or as a hideous spectacle. Foucault says that the truth of classical age madness can be found in the practices of confinement which came to surround it. The enforced disengagement of the mad with society contains inseparable parallels with the abstract contrast between reason and madness described in the book. In each case both madness and the mad are driven out of their origin. Unreason was circumscribed from reason just as the mad were removed from society, and the subjugated element in both cases became forced into a relation with its other which was coercive and silencing.          \nMadness however was more than just a tabula rasa onto which the discourse of reason was transposed. In the concluding chapter Foucault develops the books image of madness by discussing the works of Goya and Artaud which intimate that in the domain of art madness is \u201cthe absence of the work of art, the reiterated presence of that absence, its central void experienced and measured in all its endless dimensions\u201d (1961, p.272). The ontological status here is still unequivocal. Madness exists but as an externality resistant to symbolisation, which through its manifestations traverse and transgress the abstract territory of meaning. \nDreyfus and Rabinow say of Foucault\u2019s project that madness \u201cseems to be a series of approximations to an unseizable ontological condition of pure otherness... \u201d (1983 p.4). The relevant point in relation to whether Madness and Civilisation contains or enables the extrapolation of an a-historical a-cultural essence is that madness exists in-finitely as an entity inadmissible to the order of meaning that would discover its essence. Any essence of madness is a repetition of the means by which it is subjugated from inside the order of reason. This point is captured by Sprinker who says \u201cno writing can do more than reinscribe the series of terms representing reason's sovereignty over and production of madness\u201d (1980, p.83). \nAs a compliment to Dreyfus and Rabinow, Slavoj Zizek\u2019s commentary on the book asks the question \u201cis it not a version of the tension between the Real \u2013 the hyperbolic excess \u2013 and its (ultimately always failed) symbolisation?\u201d (2007, para.14). If madness as a discursive category exists through the functions of power which sustain the discourse that excludes and objectifies it, it is clear that even in reason madness is a historically determined category. There can be no madness outside the social, discursive and institutional practices that exclude it. \u201cMadness in this sense is not directly a phenomenon we can observe, but a discursive construct which emerges at a certain historical moment, together with its double, Reason in the modern sense\u201d (Zizek 2007, para.27).  This again restates the point that madness and reason in their material manifestations are both dynamic and culturally conditioned processes. \nAs with Foucault Zizek sees the term madness signifying a disavowed dimension of subjectivity whose presence persists in concert with rational knowledge. Pushing the relation of symbolised meaning and madness further, Zizek advances the thesis that, to retain his terminology, Madness and Civilisation suggests madness is a silent feature of the process of imposing symbolic order itself onto the undifferentiated chaos of the Real (2007, para.14). Psychoanalysis teaches that the frantic illusory matrixes of meaning created by the mad often constitute a desperate attempt to evade madness. The mad cling to the delusions which sustain their condition as though in reality it were their redemption. Madness inhabits their utterances implicitly, as a silent but obvious companion to explicit meaning. The madness of an utterance is insinuated, it exists simultaneously exterior to yet inseparable from the content of its medium. Where the truth of a rational statement proceeds from semantic relations to the discourse which legitimates it, in speech madness is the indeterminate exteriority of symbolic meaning; it is \u201cthe absence of the work\u201d; an absent, impossible target of, and silent addition to symbolisation. \nIn ultimately formulating madness as the \u201cabsence of the work\u201d, Foucault positions the history of madness inside a tradition in philosophy in which \u201cexistence precedes essence\u201d. Awarding ontological primacy to existence opens the field of inquiry to levels of analysis which are obscured by the search for a-historical or transcendent essence. For Foucault it is functions of power operating both upon and through discourse in historically local processes that best explain madness. Its existence is certified and elaborated upon by recounting the material processes which produced it, reaching outside an essentialist methodology and allowing this truth of madness to be heard by narrating the process of its silencing. This of corse creates substantial difficulty for speaking meaningfully about madness. If the conversation between reason and madness is really the monologue of reason on madness, Foucault is faced with the risk of participating in the discourse which excludes and subjugates it. \nThe difficulty of penetrating the book\u2019s presentation of madness is therefore an effect of this problem. In aiming to avoid that which Foucault criticises most heavily in the classical age\u2019s treatment of madness, he is faced with the task of \u201cescap[ing] the objectivist project of classical age reasoning\u201d (Derrida 1978, p.35). The formulation of madness as the absence of the work is a \u201creappropriation of negativity\u201d (1978, 35). Madness as a palpable exteriority to symbolisation could not be further from an essentialist definition. The extent to which Foucault succeeds in his archaeology of silence corresponds precisely to the extent to which the book has allowed a vision of madness to emerge through this unique utilisation of negativity. His thesis that madness is the absence of the work dissolves the conditions of possibility required for essentialism, and negativity constitutes simultaneously the springboard away from essentialism, and the most difficult obstacle to expression. Both the language of the book and its object appear as a \u201cflight toward a source that is always without light\u201d (Foucault, 1995 p.294). This avoidance of positivity is a properly methodological technique which informs how Foucault conducted the history of madness. In recounting the positive definitions that existed in the classical age most emphasis in interpretation is placed on this tyrannical and silent dimension of reason\u2019s passage to self recognition. \nOne major message of the book is that the accepted truths of madness in the classical age were multiple, and morphed with time. Conceptions of madness passed through successive continuous and discontinuous regimes of change inside shifting relations of power and discourse. Another major point is that Madness and civilisation is a unique play on the traditional difference between the two senses of the word \u2018for\u2019, in thinking \u201cwho is the book really written for?\u201d - the two senses of corse being for the attention of an Other or else writing of behalf, in place of an Other. Saying madness is the absence of the work tries to allow madness to remain in the non-identity-bound realm of the negative; the book is written for (on behalf of) a silent other, and defines madness from the perspective of this silence. This is Foucault\u2019s way of remaining faithful to his thesis that the recounted discursive and material changes have circumscribed it from reason and hidden the mad from society, thereby both obscuring and illuminating their silence. \nReferences\nDerrida, J 1980, Writing and Difference, trans.

I'll chime with one perspective with citations from recent philosophers who claim there is a difference between ethics and morality, and then try to point out how this difference (assuming one accepts it) would in turn generate a difference in ethics and moral philosophy (I thank Geoffrey Thomas for pointing out the need to clarify the latter--I've edited this post to accommodate the question he raised in a comment to the first version of this post).\nBut first, the terms \"morality\" and \"ethics\" are indeed often used interchangeably, especially in things like course titles in philosophy departments or in anthologies of essays and whatnot.\nBut some philosophers have recently done work to disambiguate the terms \"ethics\" and \"morality,\" though the distinction argued for is often contentious--a point I'll return to below. [By \"recently,\" I mean, \"within the last half-century or so\"].\nBernard Williams is an example of someone who has argued for a distinction, and it's similar to the one Joseph Weissman mentions. See Bernard Williams Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy. The basic idea here (and please someone correct me if I'm off on the details, it's been a while since I've read the book) is that ethics concerns itself with how one ought to live, and so questions like the following fall within its domain: \"What does it mean to live well?\", \"What does a good life look like?\" and even more fundamentally, \"Is 'living well' something that can be conveyed or taught?\" Morality, on the other hand, is more focused on a specific sort of value that our actions have, and involves standards we have to or ought to live up to along with constraints placed upon us. It tends to involve obligations we have to others, and these obligations are seen to have a special status that overrides non-moral ethical commitments, or non-moral courses of action that often imbue our life with meaning or involve things we care about. John Stewart-Gorden I think does a nice job capturing the distinction between Ancient conceptions of ethics as opposed to modern conceptions of morality: \"Ancient ethics is about living a good and virtuous life according to the ethical virtues, that is, to become a virtuous person, while the modern notion of morality is primarily focused on the interests of other people and the idea of deontological constraints. That is, one acts morally because one has to meet certain standards and not because it supports one\u2019s own good life\" (https://www.iep.utm.edu/anci-mod/#SH1a). In Williams's sense, morality is a subdomain of ethics (or perhaps a distinct domain that overlaps with ethics); his argument, however, turns on the idea that morality has come to dominate our understanding of ethics in such a way that we've lost something valuable in the broader Ancient Greek conception of ethics. In order to retrieve something from what Williams believes has been lost, he argues for the distinction between \"ethics\" and \"morality,\" arguing for what is wrong in particular with modern conceptions of morality that are restrictive to the point that they squelch or hinder our attempts to live well.\nFor the sake of clarity, his argument is not for some form of egocentric set of values--fulfilling our obligations to others may be a necessary part of living well. The issue is that the modern conception of morality is (for lack of a better term) overbearing, given that the obligations it issues are perceived as always overriding non-moral projects and pursuits that imbue our lives with meaning or contribute to a life well lived (modern morality's obligations are things we must do, and failure to deliver on those obligations makes us blameworthy). There are other reasons Williams gives, and other aspects of the distinction he draws between morality and ethics (e.g., modern morality strives for a problematic kind of systematization that is not found in Ancient Greek virtue ethics).\nBy \"modern conception of morality,\" Williams seems to be referring to the rise of moral theories in the 17th and 18th centuries, such as Utilitarianism and Kantianism.\nOther philosophers have argued for a similar distinction. Susan Wolf (who cites Williams) argues for a distinction between morality and well-roundedness or meaningfulness. See, for instance, Susan Wolf's \"Meaning and Morality\" in Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, vol. 97, 1997, pages 299\u2013315. Her distinction ends up seeming similar to Williams's, in that she too sees morality as dominating our ways of thinking about \"the good life\" or ways of living well. In another article (perhaps her most famous), \"Moral Saints\" (in The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 79, No. 8 [August 1982], pages 419-439), Wolf argues for this point by using as an example a figure she dubs \"the moral saint\"--\"a person whose every action is as morally good as possible, a person, that is, who is as morally worthy as can be\" (419). She claims that such a person, though they do much good in the world, seems to be lacking a well-rounded life, and is not typically someone we would desire to emulate. As Wolf states, \"In this paper, I wish to examine the notion of a moral saint, [...] to understand what a moral saint would be like and why such a being would be unattractive\" (419). Regarding the figure of the Moral Saint, Wolf states: \"The moral virtues, given that they are, by hypothesis, all present in the same individual, and to an extreme degree, are apt to crowd out the non-moral virtues, as well as many of the interests and personal characteristics that we generally think contribute to a healthy, well-rounded, richly developed character\" (421).\nSo there are philosophers who think it is important to draw a distinction between morality on the one hand (typically concerned with obligations or things we have or ought to do, and is generally focused on other people), and ethics (or some broader notion a how to live well) on the other.\nWhat would this mean for our understanding of ethics and moral philosophy?\nIf one believes that there is a meaningful distinction between ethics and morality, then ethics in a philosophical context is inquiry into things like: \"what does it mean to live well?\", \"what is a good life?\", and \"what are the relevant sorts of considerations regarding what makes a life good?\" Aristotle's ethics would be exemplify ethical inquiry as something distinct from moral philosophy. His Nicomachean Ethics is primarily concerned with: (1) \"What does it mean to live well?\", the (simplified) answer to which is \"a life characterized by eudaimonia [a notoriously difficult word to translate, but which is often translated as, \"fulfillment,\" \"flourishing,\" or \"happiness\"--but a notion of happiness that is hard to capture (it is not happiness as contrasted to sadness or other emotional states, which is why it is perhaps best to understand it in terms of \"flourishing\"]; and (2) \"How can one live well?\", the simplified answer to which is (A) a life characterized by virtuous activity (which for Aristotle means actualizing certain dispositions or character traits that exemplify human excellence) along with (B) possessing certain \"goods\" (e.g., a certain degree of material wealth, such that you can devote your time to actualizing your virtuous dispositions rather than trying to find where your next meal will come from). The Stoics, to provide another example, more or less agree with Aristotle on the point about actualizing virtuous (i.e., \"excellent\") character traits, but differ with him on the role of possessing goods--all that it takes to live well by the Stoics lights is virtuous action (Stoics even tend to believe that should the virtuous action fail to achieve its aim, it does not detract from the value of the action, nor does that failure negatively impact the goodness of one's life--the good life just is the life of virtuous activity). Ethics--at least ancient ethics--thus often asks questions about what sorts of character traits are virtues (what sorts of character traits count as dispositions that exemplify human excellence), but ethical inquiry does so with an eye to issues of living well (moral philosophy might ask \"what count as virtues?\" but this has less to do with living well and more to do with \"acting morally\" and acting in a way that meets the demands of specifically moral obligations).\nMoral philosophy would ask (overlapping) questions like, \"What makes an action possess moral worth?\", \"What is moral worth?\", \"What makes an action right or wrong?\", \"On what basis do the obligations that a moral system issues possess their authoritative, overriding status?\" and \"What sorts of actions or things are moral or immoral, and what makes them so?\" Theories offered by moral philosophers provide different answers to these questions. I'll provide two examples. For Kant, it is a good will that makes an action possess moral worth; what makes the obligations of morality special and overriding is that they meet the demands of certain duties we have in virtue of being rational, autonomous agents. For a Utilitarian, moral worth is determined by maximizing positive states of affairs (or minimizing negative states of affairs), or by one's best effort to maximize positive states of affairs (or minimize negative states of affairs); what makes an obligation overriding is that it maximizes positive states of affairs (or minimizes negative states of affairs) regardless of whether this incurs some degree of harm to the person performing this action (or makes this person's situation worse than it otherwise would have been). What makes a state of affairs positive or negative for a Utilitarian is hard to define in detail (different Utilitarians will disagree on these details), but generally Utilitarians operate with some conception of pleasure or happiness--so what it is you (morally) ought to do is decided in terms of increasing overall pleasure (even if that means sacrificing some of your own pleasure--e.g., donating X amount of money to help feed 10 starving families, instead of keep X amount money that you could otherwise use to buy yourself some luxury item purely for your own pleasure). Moral philosophy can also ask broader questions like, \"What is a value?\" or \"What is it that we mean when we call something (morally) good?\", though these questions begin to move into the territory of the metaphysics of value, or what's sometimes called \"value theory\" or \"axiology.\" But note that moral philosophy, should one accept a distinction between ethics and morality, is not asking questions about how to live well, or what a well lived life looks like; it's bringing philosophical scrutiny to questions concerning what it is right to do.\nThe above distinction between ethics and morality (and the potential difference it implies for ethics as a domain of philosophical inquiry and moral philosophy) is contentious, as I noted. Some moral philosophers argue--as an undergraduate, I had a professor that made this argument--that morality simply concerns itself with what you ought to do, end of story. For him, that meant that the moral saint, for instance, is perhaps not actually doing what she ought to do if she is sacrificing well-roundedness in her own life in order to maximize doing good for others. So for this professor, morality is the broader category, and inquiry into \"how to live well\" is a subdomain of moral philosophy. And he thought there was no reason to suppose that \"what we ought to do\" always involves obligations that override all our other, non-moral concerns.\nIt might seem that this is just an argument about how to define terms, and in a sense it is. But for someone like Williams, and I take it Wolf as well, it tracks certain historical trends. The exemplary ethicist is someone like Aristotle, and the paradigm for ethics is Ancient Greek virtue ethics. Something seems to have changed in modern conceptions of value that gave rise to what Williams sees as morality. As Williams sees it, it's not just that ethical values gave way to moral values, it's that philosophy itself became less concerned with ethics and more concerned morality--i.e., ethics as a mode of philosophical inquiry waned as moral philosophy waxed. And Williams, in turn, uses this distinction to understand certain figures in the history of philosophy, such as Nietzsche (19th century) who pit himself against morality. So it's not just an arbitrary decision on Williams's part to draw this distinction--he thinks it tracks something in the history of philosophy, and uses it to interpret certain trends, movements, changes, and figures in the history of philosophy.\nAs a relevant side note, it is indeed true, as Bob notes, that \"ethics\" (from Ancient Greek) and \"morality\" (from Latin) are both based on terms that in their original languages mean something like customs, habits, conventions, or the like. But it is worth noting that Cicero (a Roman), when translating Greek works, decided to translate the Greek \"ethikos\" into Latin as \"moralis\" (see https://www.etymonline.com/word/moral and https://www.iep.utm.edu/anci-mod/#SH1a).\nWhile I don't remember Williams arguing for this, I do recall reading (though I can't cite a source, my apologies) that this point has historical importance: Despite the similarities in meaning between the Ancient Greek \"ethikos\" and the Latin \"moralis,\" Cicero's works were the go-to in the Roman world for all things Greek (at least all things Greek philosophy). So Cicero makes this translation decision, and many centuries later, as Roman religious practices wane and Christianity comes to the fore, Christianity picks up the term morality (or rather, \"moralis\"), and over time, morality turns into the sort of system of values Williams sees it as--leaving \"ethics\" to refer more exclusively to Ancient Greek conceptions of value in terms of a life well lived (connected to certain complicated notions of happiness or \"eudaemonia\")--until for whatever reason, ethics was picked up again more recently as either a synonym for the (at this point changed) meaning of morality, or as applied moral theory (as in \"business ethics\" and \"biomedical ethics\").\nFor someone Williams, ethics as a mode of philosophical inquiry into varieties of living well has been overshadowed by the concerns of moral philosophy, and the original meaning of ethics, and the inquiry that defined it, was lost; moral philosophy and its concerns assimilated the term ethics without assimilating the mode or object of inquiry that originally defined it. This is why moral philosophy and ethics are often taken to be the same pursuit, and why someone like Williams was motivated to disambiguate ethics from morality (since to do so would be to retrieve ethics as a distinct mode of philosophical inquiry with an object different from that moral philosophy).\nAnd last side note, with respect to Frank Hubeny's question (March 30th), Aristotle claims that ethics is the domain centered on how individuals can live well (and what it means for them to live well), and politics is about this question applied to collectives (to the polis, or city-state); he actually sees politics as the larger, more important category, and ethics as (in some sense) a subdomain of politics, because the focus of ethics is smaller.\n[Thanks again to Geoffrey Thomas for constructive criticism, which I hope this edited response has adequately addressed.]\n"}]}

Take for instance, omnipotence (often the source of these paradoxes).  Here's what St. Paul said about Jesus' power:\n\nHave this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.  -- Philippians 2:5-11 (ESV)\n\nNote that by using the word \"form\" (\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03b71 in the Greek) Paul is referencing Plato (or at least the ideas of Plato, which he'd been trained in).  Jesus started with the \"shape\" or form of God, which meant that he was identical to God on a Platonic level.  It isn't a perfect choice of words, as we shall see in a moment, but it speaks in terms his listeners would understand.\nFrom there, Paul says Jesus took on a different form, that of a servant and a man.  \nThe idea that anyone could take on a different form than their own is nonsensical within Platonic thought2.  A god attempting to become a man is the equivalent of attempting to \"draw a circle that is square\" as Cody Gray suggests in the comments to the question.  But Paul is trying to express an idea about God that is completely novel: a god that has power to change even his own form.  Elsewhere, Paul admits this concept of God appears foolish.\nThe whole idea of a God becoming a man so that he can be executed, which will allow him to be exalted, is on the face absurd.  If you want to dismiss the whole thing as nonsense, you may.  In that case, it should be no surprise that there are dozens of paradoxes in addition to the first bit of nonsense.  But you really can't expect those paradoxes to be convincing to those of us who have accepted the far more absurd idea that God would allow himself to be executed.  And if the only people who are convinced they are a problem are the people who already reject the basic notion of Christianity, these paradoxes aren't very interesting arguments.  They are a sort of straw man.\nAt least one solution to the various paradoxes is suggested in this passage: God may chose to be limited.  Can God die?  Yes, if He chooses.  Can God change what He knows what will happen tomorrow?  Yes, if He chooses.  Can God create a stone He can not lift?  Yes, if He chooses.  Can He lift that stone?  Yes, if He chooses.3 \nDoes this mean He is nonsensical?  Not obviously.  He may, of course, choose to be sensible to humanity.  \n\nHere's a thought that occurred to me this morning: God's ability to create a stone that he cannot move is analogous to quantum superposition.  Like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, which is both alive and dead, some theists believe that God is both able to create such a stone and also to move it.  When we open the box, the superposition collapses and we see either a dead or a lucky cat.  When God decides, he may either create such a stone or move it.  (Personally, I think it unlikely God spends even as much time considering this choice as we have in this question.  This stone seems to belong entirely to philosophers.)  The superposition collapses if and when God actualizes such a stone.  If so, God's definition is paradoxical, but so is the observed state of the universe.  \nNotice that in both cases, the superposition state collapses because of a choice: the observer decides to open the box and God decides to make something.  In many ways, all of our choices collapse superpositions.  Paradoxically, we really can't do all the things that \nwe are able to do.  I am able to write this paragraph and I am able to not write it, but I can't do both.  As I see it, the question is really asking about a paradox of choice in general using, in typical philosophical fashion, the most extreme example: a being not bond by any external entity when it comes to making decisions.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1 would have been an even stronger callback to Plato, which may be why Paul didn't use it.\nGod becoming man is equally nonsensical to Jewish thought, but for very different reasons.\nVinko Vrsalovic suggested about this paragraph that it's the same or equivalent to \"It is inconsistent as seen from a logical framework.\" to quote Lennart Regebro's answer.  I disagree.  Consider this example: I have the power to jump off a high building, cut my wrists and crash my car into a wall at 100 MPH.  But I don't do these things because I chose not to.  Or suppose I had the ability to tread water forever.  That doesn't mean I must always demonstrate that power. Or to put things another way, God has the power to break the rules of logic, but for whatever reason doesn't.  Whatever his purposes may be, they do not include the need to make a stone he cannot move.\n\n"}]}

A satisfactory definition must include a way to determine what can be expected of an omnipotent and omnipresent entity, and a procedure to find observable consequences of such an entity. If this cannot be done, the logical positist would say the question is meaningless in the sense of Carnap, an abuse of language.\nStill, one can attempt to produce a more precise version of these things. When one does something like this, the result is often a logical contradiction.\nHere is an example of a logical argument against omniscience:\n\"God doesn't know this statement is true.\" where by \"this statement\" I mean the very same statement in quotes.\nIf God knows this statement is true, then it is false, and God does not know it, in which case it is true.\nDoes God know that statement is true? Is this statement true or false?\n(this is a variation on the well-known philosopher's sentiment \"Searle cannot consistently believe this statement\". Variations on this are found in Hofstadter's Metamagical Themas, \"On Self Referential Sentences\")\nYou can rephrase this as the religious doctrine of Maimonism. This is the main article of Maimonism:\n\n\"There is an omniscient God, who knows the truth or falsity of all religious doctrines, and, unfortunately for Maimonism, this God does not agree with the main article.\"\n\nYou can agree with Maimonism if you want, but God can't have a consistent opinion about it. In the preceding sentence, I assumed that the reader isn't God.\nYou might think that \"this statement\" is cheating. But it is easy to avoid using this construction, by a well known trick from computer science:\n\nConsider the named strings A=\"consider the named strings\",B=\"; then God doesn't know the fact asserted by the straightforward English meaning of the sentences formed by the concatenation of string A, an 'A', an equal sign, a quote, string A, a quote, a comma, a 'B', an equal sign, a quote, string B, a quote, and string B\"; then God doesn't know the fact asserted by the straightforward English meaning of the sentences formed by the concatenation of string A, an 'A', an equal sign, a quote, string A, a quote, a comma, a 'B', an equal sign, a quote, string B, a quote, and string B.\"\n\nThis is a self-reproducing sentence. If you follow the instructions, you reproduce the very-same sentence that is giving you the instructions, and then the sentence asserts that the constructed sentence (itself) is not known by God, and the paradox is as before.\nBut this is not really a meaningful paradox the way I see it, in light of logical positivism. In order to make this fully meaningful, one needs to assume God's knowledge is queriable, so that the sentence has a meaningful procedure to determine truth or falsehood. If God is queriable regarding the truth of all sentences, then God becomes an oracle, and the halting problem with a queriable oracle is just as unsolvable as the halting problem without, so there are questions which the God oracle cannot answer using the procedure, at least not in finite time.\nThese paradoxes are due to Godel and Turing, and they are made precise using computer programs and purported oracles regarding the behavior of these computer programs. Such oracles cannot be computer programs, and if these oracles are realized in the physical world, they cannot be queried in finite time without leading to contradiction.\nBut the contradiction evaporates if you imagine that the oracle only knows at infinite time. So this is only saying that we cannot know God's opinion at finite time. This is analogous to the Catholic doctrine of \"gradual revelation\", that God's will is revealed more perfectly through time, and through the action of the holy spirit. So theologians do not have to worry about such contradictions, unless they wish to give meaning to \"God does not know this sentence\".\nMy opinion is that it is best not to worry about these paradoxes, and instead give a meaningful logical postivist definition for God that allows God to be subject to rational investigation. If this cannot be done, then God is not a meaningful concept.

Not really plausible in my opinion (and quite rarely mentioned), but here goes. It's based on Cantor's theorem, saying a powerset (set of all subsets) of a given set always has larger cardinality (you can't \"map\" the bigger onto smaller) than the original set.\nAssume there is an infinite amount of facts (in Wittgenstein-style universe). Let's label the facts with natural numbers, so for example 1 might mean \"Earth exists\", 2 might mean \"Sun is bigger than Earth\" etc.\nIf God knows everything, he knows all these facts, so he knows infinite amount of things. Since God is God, knowing infinite amount of things doesn't seem to be a problem. \nBut if God knows \"1\" and \"2\", then he also knows \"1 and 2\"; that is, he also knows conjunctions of things he knows. Since God is so mighty, it seems plausible he knows not only finite conjunctions, but also infinite. \nSo God knows things like \"7 and 59\", \"1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and ...\", \"1 and 3 and 5 and 7 and 9 and ...\", \"1 and 2 and 3 and 5 and 8 and 13 and 21 and ...\"\nHow many things does God know? He knows at least |N| amount of things (as many as natural numbers), but by Cantor's theorem and the above mentioned conjunction-generation then he also must know at least |P(N)| things, where P(x) denotes powerset of x.\nBut if God knows |P(n)| amount of things, he must also know |P(P(n))| things. And so on. This progression never stops, but it would have to stop somewhere if God's knowledge was a valid set.\nWhat exactly does this argument show? It shows there is no set containing God's knowledge assuming God's knowledge is deductively closed (If X knows A, and X knows A -> B, then X knows B - this doesn't seem to be controversial principle if X is godlike). Some possible conclusions: \n\nGod's knowledge isn't a set. Possible interpretation: God's knowledge is so awesome we can't capture it by throwing it in a set. \nGod isn't omniscient; if we insist there must be a set of things X knows (which seems like a plausible thing to wish for), then God can't be omniscient, since we produced a paradox.\nGod's knowledge might not be (completely) deductively closed; perhaps he has a machine (which would, by the way, be required to do infinite tasks if we allow infinite conjunctions) that will check his countable knowledge of pure facts and then output whether a given statement is true or false, without requiring the statement itself to be inside God's knowledge. \nThis really is a serious paradox, but since God is all-powerful, it's not really a problem.\n\n"}]}

It is easy enough to find plenty of counter-examples.\nIt matters that it is inconsistent because we use reason to judge truthfulness. Reason isn't limited to science. It is used in history or in art neither of which is scientific.\nBut we also use authority to judge truthfulness. For example, very few people are able to judge the correctness and truth of Fermat's Theorem for themselves. For those who are interested they accept the judgement of those best able to judge: Mathematicians trained in modern number theory. \nWithin Islam, it is the Prophet who is the authority. For Christianity, I assume that it is Jesus. They, according to tradition, have direct knowledge of Allah or God. Allah or God has 'spoken' to them. This, one might say, is a 'private' language. Private languages do not have the same form that public speech has among us. For this to be understood by the rest of us it has to be translated into public speech. It is in this translation that inconsistencies appear. \nA separate argument is that Allah/God is not limited by logic. In the Tractatus, Wittgenstein points out:\n\n3.031 It used to be said that God could create everything, except what was contrary to the laws of logic. The truth is, we could not say of an \u201cunlogical\u201d world how it would look.\n\nIn Ash'arite theology, and Aquinas made a similar argument, Allah/God is outside of both time and space. One might suppose also that he is outside of logic. I assume it is easier to imagine that Allah/God is outside of time and space than of logic. Wittgenstein certainly believed so:\n\n3.0321 We could present spatially an atomic fact which contradicted the laws of physics, but not one which contradicted the laws of geometry.\n\nOne should interpret 'spatially' as the space of logical possibilities, and 'geometry' as logic. (One might note here that modern number theory and logic have a geometrical form.)\nThat is we can imagine it, but we certainly cannot 'present' it.\nOne might introduce here the ideas of intuitionistic logic where the law of the excluded middle is denied. Of course the meta-logic is still classical. So this still follows Wittgenstein's prescription. That is, we haven't presented a non-classical logic in the proper sense, but simply imagined one.\n"}]}

Quick Answer:\nThere is no valid definition of God as \"omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent\" - this is a false presupposition, and begging the question.  This definition is not remotely Biblical - as these supposed \"qualities\" are ripped out of their contexts.\n\n\"The Most High\" cannot be omniscient - if he forgives.\n\"The Most High\" cannot be \"Omnipotent\" - if he is restrained by his own word.\n\"The Most High\" cannot be \"Omnipresent\" - if he declared that he would remove his presence from the wicked.\n\n\n2. Even Classical Theism asserts a limitation to all-powerful gods - themselves:\nCommonly, every definition of God, (the Greeks, Judaism, and Christianity), are all consistent with \"Gods choosing to limit their own power\".\nThis self-restraint is not a contradiction of \"omnipotent power\" - but rather affirms greater power to keep their word - despite any resistance:\n\nHomer Hom. Il. 14.270, et al: [270] So spake she, and Sleep waxed glad, and made answer saying: \u201cCome now, swear to me by the inviolable water of Styx, and with one hand lay thou hold of the bounteous earth, and with the other of the shimmering sea, that one and all they may be witnesses betwixt us twain, even the gods that are below with Cronos,\nEur. Hipp. 1296: Artemis: You have done dreadful deeds, but for all that it is still possible for you to win pardon for these things. Aphrodite willed that things should happen thus, sating her anger. Among the gods the custom is this: no god contrives to cross the will of another,\nPlat.

How Scripture Actually Defines \"The Most High\":\nThe pop-culture definition provided in the question is ripped out of context from Scripture as well as classical history.  However, Scriptural theism requires that any definition of \"The Most High\" must be internally consistent - because, \"God is True\".\nThe Scriptural Definition requires absolute \"Internal Consistency\":\nIn Scripture, the attributes of God -- go MUCH further than claiming \"internal consistency\" -- these attributes are inter-dependent on each other -- none of which would be sufficient alone.\nNot any particular order, cyclically inter-dependent -- inseparable.\n3.1. God is True:\n\nPsalm 33:4:\nFor the word of the Lord is upright, And all His work is done in [trustworthiness].\nMalachi 3:5, NASB:\n\u201cThen I will draw near to you for judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against those who swear falsely, and against those who oppress the wage earner in his wages, the widow and the orphan, and those who turn aside the alien and do not fear Me,\u201d says the Lord of hosts.\nTitus 1:2, NASB:\n... in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago, ...\n\n3.2. God is Just:\n\nPsalms 82:1-4:\nGod takes His stand in His own congregation; He judges in the midst of the rulers. 2 How long will you judge unjustly And show partiality to the wicked? 3 Vindicate the weak and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and destitute. 4 Rescue the weak and needy; Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked. ...\nIsaiah 61:8, NASB:\nFor I, the Lord, love justice, I hate robbery in the burnt offering; And I will faithfully give them their recompense And make an everlasting covenant with them.\n\n3.3. God is Love, through Mercy towards the merciful:\nNote:  As God loves mercy and the humbled, he must hate oppression and the oppressor.\n\nPsalm 11:5, NASB:\nThe Lord tests the righteous and the wicked, And the one who loves violence His soul hates.\nZechariah 8:17:\nAlso let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,\u2019 declares the Lord.\u201d\nPsalm 146:8:\nThe Lord opens the eyes of the blind; The Lord raises up those who are bowed down; The Lord loves the [just], (righteous);\n\nThis is the only possible internally consistent 3-dimensional definition of God.

If the base omni terms themselves are logically inconsistent then the definition itself is not logical and cannot be evaluated logically\n 2. If the original terms are defined in a logically consistent way, then there is no logical inconsistency in the definition.\nI believe #1 is self-evident and therefore the remainder of this answer comprises developing #2.\n\nI'm not sure that the omni-everything being is really a \"common definition\" of God, but I will assent to it for my answer.  I tweak the \"omni\" definitions as follows to make sure they are logically consistent, and add the term \"omnibenevolent\":\n\nOmnipotent - all-powerful - can do anything that can be done\nOmniscient - knows everything there is to know about the universe (all matter that exists, all states of that matter, the preceding at all points in time, etc.)\nOmnipresent - The most important aspect of this is that it entails time.  God is present everywhere and at all times - simultaneously.  This is similar to Omniscience in practice (perhaps the means of his omniscience).  The reason for this is that we live in (at least) a 4 dimensional universe, not 3-D.\nOmnibenevolent - I don't like this term, because \"all-good\" is not quite correct.  Better to say all his actions/desires are always good.  Of course, this begs the question of what \"good\" means.\n\n\nWhy do I modify the \"omni\" terms?  Because the terms themselves are often defined in an illogical manner.  And when that is the case, of course any definition using them will be logically inconsistent as well.  Let me explain with \"omnipotent\":\nIf you say that an omnipotent being can do \"anything\", then you are claiming that an omnipotent being can do both logical and illogical things.  This definition of omnipotent exists both partly in and partly outside the realm of logic, and thus logic cannot only speak to part of it, and cannot even understand the rest of it, nor forward any arguments about that part.  Logic itself only works within the framework of logical things.\nOne solution to this is to claim that, indeed, God can do both logical and illogical things - that he truly has all power.  This is expounded on in the most popular answer here.  However, in this case, we cannot say anything about the part of the definition of God which is outside of logic.  Note that unlike what that answer said, this does not mean we cannot know anything about such a God - it only means we cannot know about the part of God which exists outside of logic.  The part that operates within logic we can still know and understand.\nHowever, if we define \"omnipotent\" as \"all-powerful\", in the sense that an omnipotent being has all power that can or does actually exist at his disposal - anything that can be done, he can do - then we remain within the realm of logic and we can apply logic to determine whether the definition is logically consistent.\nI know I am belaboring this point, but it is the crux of the problem with the arguments that are raised against an \"omni-x\" being.\n\nSo, why does the above matter?\nThe vast majority of attacks against the \"omni-everything\" being takes the form of asking the being to do something that is logically impossible.  In other words, the power to do it cannot exist, based on our understanding of how the universe operates.  But why should an all-powerful being be asked to do something that cannot be done?  Why should they be asked to create something that cannot be created?  If an omnipotent being can do anything that actually can be done, and can create anything that it is possible for some force or being to create - if it can create anything that is comprehensible to us or can be real to us - that is enough!\nCan God create a square-circle?  Well, if a square-circle is an abstract concept which is illogical (another word for illogical is incomprehensible), then why should you ask him to create something which means nothing to you and has no connection to our universe or reality as we know it?  It is a meaningless request!\nGranted, it may be possible to create a square-circle, because our knowledge of the universe is limited.  We experience it only in 4 dimensions.  Various theories imply there may be as many as 10 or 11 dimensions, and if we find that to be true then once we understand what that means, then a square-circle might end up being a logical and possible construct.  If so - then an omnipotent being is able to create a square-circle, but as long as a square-circle is a meaningless, incomprehensible construction, then an omnipotent being would not need to create one to have \"all-power\" that does exist.\nThe other way to look at omni-potent, is to understand that no other being exists which has a power which he does not, and no other being has a power which he cannot override.  This is the same thing as stating an omnipotent being has \"all-power which does exist\", and is a logically consistent definition.\nOnce this core principle of making sure that the original definition is logical in the first place, is applied to all the \"omni\" terms, so that it is even possible to evaluate the resulting definition of an omni-everything being, then the majority of arguments against it simply dissolve away as not meeting the criteria of the definition.  I will leave it at that with regard to the other \"omni\" terms, as I've already gone too long here.\n\nNow, there are some arguments which still stand after we get the logically inconsistent ones out of the way.  The main one is the \"Problem of Evil/Suffering\".  The first major philosophical formulation of an answer to it can be found on the Alvin Plantinga Free Will Defense page on Wikipedia. The short answer to that one is that it is better to have a world with real love/relationships (which requires free will), then to have a world without suffering/evil.  This, of course, is somewhat subjective and hangs on the definition of what \"good\" means, but it is a logically consistent solution to the problem, whether one agrees with the conclusion or not.\nI give a more detailed answer to the Problem of Evil/Suffering here.\n"}]}

Obviously, our estimates as humans about what is possible is limited by our finite nature, but while our knowledge is incomplete we also know that we can know some things truly. We neither need to invoke mystery (our ignorance) nor God's incapacity (lacking omnipotence) to understand some of this topic. We can safely know that God being \"unable to do certain things\" is an expression of superiority and power, not lack of them. All actions and inactions can be cast as the negation of their opposite inactions and actions.\nFor example, the fastest race car in the world cannot lose a race. Do we say this car is inferior to all other cars because it cannot do something all of them can do\u2014lose a race? No! Despite the negative framing, being unable to lose a race is a capacity\u2014the ability to win every race.\nGod has so much ability and power that he is able to avoid all illogic! One can frame this as \"being unable to be illogical\" and gloat that we have a power he does not, but you'd sound about as ridiculous as a race car driver who has just lost the world championships taunting the winner \"Ha ha, you can't even lose a race like I did! You suck!\"\nGod knows what he will do in the future and this is no limitation. You can frame this negatively as \"he can't change his mind\" but you must remember that being able to change your mind is a product of being finite and having imperfect information, imperfect reasoning, or imperfect control. God doesn't ever need to change his mind because he never makes mistakes that would necessitate doing so.\n"}]}

Large portions of both documents read as if they were quoted directly from some of his works. And the concepts espoused, both implicitly and explicitly, by both documents are backed by concepts he advanced. In particular, things like natural rights, collective sovereignty, religious tolerance, the necessity to impose restraints on the exercise of arbitrary power of the executive, etc.\nHe even preached specifically in favor of the right to revolution, claiming that because all people have the fundamental rights to life, liberty, and property under the natural law, they could instigate a revolution against the government whenever it verifiably acted against those interests of its citizens. In some cases, Locke even insisted that revolution was an obligation, insofar as it provided a bulwark against tyranny.\nThis, as you can well imagine, was often cited as a justification for the American Revolution.\nIf you're interested in reading more about this, the best place to start is with Locke's extremely well-known Two Treatises of Government, paying particular attention to the second treatise, which is his polemic in favor of a civil society based on natural rights. The entire book is even available as a free download (in various formats) from Project Gutenberg.\n\nOthers of our laws, particularly those in the juridical realm, like those you cite (intent, burden of proof, no cruel or unusual punishment, jury of your peers, no double jeopardy, etc.) are based on the writings of the French Enlightenment thinker, Montesquieu.\nWe of course didn't apply everything that he advocated, but there's no denying his strong influence. His The Spirit of the Laws was widely read by the American \"founding fathers\" and widely disseminated throughout the original British colonies, where they seemed to capture mass appeal because of the growing tensions with England over things like representation in taxation and the right to political liberty.\nIn particular, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay, in their collected set of writings that were published as The Federalist Papers and argued in favor of the new Constitution, cited Montesquieu at length. Madison famously wrote in The Federalist, number 47:\n\nThe oracle who is always consulted and cited on this subject, is the celebrated Montesquieu. If he be not the author of this invaluable precept in the science of politics, he has the merit at least of displaying and recommending it most effectually to the attention of mankind.\n\nHe was also very much responsible for what became known as the Separation of Powers doctrine, enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, derived from his commentary on Britain's tripartite constitutional system.\n"}]}

In full generality, you can state the syntactic version of the First Incompleteness Theorem as follows:\n\n(G1T) For any effectively axiomatized theory T that extends Q there exists a T-sentence G such that: (i) If T is consistent then T cannot prove G (ii) If T is omega-consistent then T cannot prove \u00acG.\n\nThis is as general a statement of the theorem as you can get. Note that Kleene - in your quotation - is talking about the semantic version of the theorem. What Godel originally proved however involved no semantic notions such as truth, arithmetical truth etc. Whether or not you can see/recognize/acknowledge G as true depends on the semantic/intensional understanding of G - it is a common misconception that Godel wanted to prove the limitations of arithmetical truth. The background he was working against was Hilbertian formalism - so his primary concern was to demonstrate the purely syntactic limitations of formal systems. So, in full syntactic generality, (G1T) says (informally) that no approriate manipulation of symbols in any formal system complicated enough to contain some arithmetic will end up with G.\nSo you can see that (G1T) applies to a vast array of formal systems. Whether you choose to see the G's obtained as 'unprovable truths' depends on your semantics/ on whether your T has an intended interpretation and so on. But in most usual cases that kind of conclusion is considered justified. But it only arises because of the subvenient syntactic glitch that (G1T) ensures.\nNow as for philosophical implications, the literature is immense. I will mention some pertinent issues:\n\nSome people have seen (semantic) (G1T) as a cogent argument against mechanism, i.e. against the thesis that minds are machines. The locus classicus is Lucas' Minds, Machines and Godel. Penrose extends and fortifies the argument in his books on consciousness. Ripostes to these arguments abound, see especially Putnam's Minds and Machines.\nMichael Dummett in the aptly titled 'The Philosophical Significance of Godel's Theorem' has argued that (G1T) may be construed as an argument against the thesis that meaning is use, by demonstrating to us that the use of any symbolic manipulation is always outrun by arithmetical truth and meaning. He introduces the notion of indefinite extensibility to salvage the thesis and provokes a lot of debate along thhe way.\nThere are certain versions of Hilbert's Programme (HP) that can be said to have been refuted by (G1T). Nevertheless it is usually the Second Incompleteness Theorem that most people take to be the final nail in the coffin of (HP). Arguably this is the most monumental philosophical contribution of Godel's epoch-making discovery, namely that it single-handedly refuted Hilbertian formalism. Although, again, there are some research projects that can be seen as partial realizations of HP that are being carried out to this day - especially noteworthy in this direction are Detlefsen and Feferman.\n\nFinally, I should like to say that countless philosophically-minded authors/thinkers/hacks have appropriated Godel's Theorem to try and make points about self-reference/loops/God/metaphysics/environmental awareness and God knows what else. The three implications I raised may seem dry and academic but they are also precise, well-studied and free from hyperbole. There is no doubt that Godel's theorems propelled our understanding of formal systems forward - and with it, our understanding of the philosophical powers and weaknesses of formal reasoning. \n"}]}

The original presentation is before the invention of the computer, and is complicated. But we live 80 years later, where computers are familiar.\nFirst, in Godel's theorem, you are always talking about an axiomatic system S. This is a logical system in which you can prove theorems by a computer program, you should think of Peano Arithmetic, or ZFC, or any other first order theory with a computable axiom schema (axioms that can be listed by a fixed computer program).\nSuch an axiom system is assumed to be able to describe a computer at any finite time. The memory contents of a computer is a string of bits, a large integer M, and the manipulations on the memory from running one step is a very simple function, which does something from the instruction set and changes the memory. If you do this a finite number of times, you get a new memory state M'. The basic assumption on S is this:\n\nS can follow a computer program: given a fixed universal computer with initial memory M, it will prove that the memory at time t is M' for any finite time t.\n\nIn Peano Arithmetic this is trivial, because you can code a computer's memory in very simple ways, and the axioms without induction, just the axioms for calculating stuff, tell you what the result of a finite calculation is. So this is true in Peano Arithmetic without induction and without quantifiers. It's a very simple thing to ask of an axiom system--- that it can follow a computation and prove that the result at finite time is correct.\nNext, we assume that S can state things like \"Program P does not halt\". This requires a quantifier\nI assume S is consistent. The statement \"S is consistent\" means that if S proves \"P does not halt\", then P in fact does not halt. Since if P halts, S would follow it until it halts, and then prove this too. Note that S can prove \"P halts\" without P actually halting, it just can't prove \"P doesn't halt\" if this is a lie.\nTheorem: Consider such an axiom system S. There is a program P which doesn't halt for which S can't prove \"P doesn't halt\":\nProof: Write the computer program SPITE to do the following:\n\nPrint its own code into a variable R\nDeduce all consequences of the axioms of S, looking for the theorem \"R does not halt\"\nIf it finds this theorem, it halts.\n\nIf you think about it for half a second, the moment S proves \"SPITE doesn't halt\" SPITE halts (by construction) and makes S a liar. The self-reference is in the first line--- printing your own code into a variable, and that this is possible is an exercise given to undergraduate programmers.\nThat's the complete construction, and the complete proof.\nGodel 2: S cannot prove itself consistent\nThe proof is as follows: if S is consistent, SPITE can't halt, because we see that this implies S is inconsistent. So if S can formalize this argument and it can prove itself consistent, it proves SPITE does not halt (which is impossible).\nThat's the complete proof. It requires familiarity with logic to see that for appropriate S, the informal deduction \"S is consistent implies SPITE doesn't halt\" can be formalized in S, but if it weren't possible to formalize intuitive logical deductions like this, we wouldn't be using S in the first place.\nRosser: The problem with Godel1 and Godel2 (which are essentially the same theorem up to a trivial choice of canonical example), is that S could still be complete but wrong. In other words, Godel's proof didn't show that there is a program P whose halting is not predicted at all. Maybe S decides all programs either halt or don't halt, but it doesn't get it right--- it tells you that some non-halting programs halt. If it told you that a halting program didn't halt, this would be a contradiction in S (after enough time), but it can tell you a non-halting program halts without contradiction (this is obvious, but subtle).\nSo write ROSSER:\n\nPrints its code into R\nDeduces from S, looks for a) \"R prints to the screen\" b) \"R doesn't print to the screen\".\nIf it finds a) it halts without printing. If it finds b) it prints \"hello\" and halts.\n\nNow S cannot prove either \"ROSSER prints\" or the negation \"ROSSER doesn't print\". So that if a second program follows Rosser and halts when ROSSER prints, this program is not proved either halting or non-halting.\nPhilosophical implications\nThe main philosophical implication is the most important in the history of philosophy (this is not an overstatement):\n\nThere exists a universal notion of computation, which is independent of the axiom system.\n\nThis is the main result of Godel's work, although it wasn't fully understood until Turing's version a few years later. But Godel was groping towards this, as he understood this was true very quickly after proving the theorem, and he recognized Turing as having provided the explanation and abandoned his own approach to computation in favor of Turing's. The reason I can get away with such a proof as above is because we all are familiar with the notion of \"a computer\" and \"a computer program\", and we all know that any precise algorithm can be programmed on a computer, and that one computer is as good as another.\nImmediate philosophical implications:\n\nThere is an agreed-upon notion of what it means to have a precisely defined set of rules.\nYou can actually build a machine which can simulate any other precisely defined set of rules.\nAny two such machines are equivalent--- A can simulate B and B can simulate A.\nIf physics exists (if there is a precise set of rules, even probabilistic rules, to model nature), the universal machine (equipped with a random number generator) can simulate anything in nature.\n\nFrom this it follows that:\n\nThe complete behavior of the human being can be simulated by a universal computer.\n\nWith the plausible logical positivistic assumption, this means that\n\nA computer is a machine capable of thinking.\n\nThis insight is due to Turing. Von Neumann has the following insight:\n\nA computer is a machine which is capable of modelling the behavior of biological systems. Godel's theorem is analogous to self-replication.\n\nThese are far and away the most important philosophical insights of all time. The precurser to this is Liebnitz attempts to make a philosophical machine, which could reason mechanically. Leibnitz understood a few of the implications of a computer.\nPhilosophical implications of Godel's theorem itself\nGodel's theorem showed that, if you take the philosophical position that the statement \"program P doesn't halt\" is absolutely meaningful, then there is no fixed axiomatic system capable of proving all these meaningful truths. This is sort of obvious--- the program deducing from the axioms can't prove too much about itself without contradiction.\nBut more importantly, it shows you how to produce stronger systems--- by adjoining the axiom \"S is consistent\", you get a new system which makes the system stronger. This means that any axiom system has a stronger one, the Godel reflection\n\nS + \"S is consistent\"\n\nis strictly stronger than S.\nYou can iterate this procedure, by iterating the Godel reflection. There is no barrier at infinity--- you can consider the system which is the infinitieth Godel reflection to be the union of all the theorems proved at the n-th stage (there is a specific program which will print out the deductions--- you don't need set theory to make the iteration precise, at least not for small enough infinite ordinals). The process of iterating Godel's reflection reproduces Cantor's ordinals.\nThis answers the question of mathematical philosophy\n\nWhy are ordinals necessary?\n\nIt completely justifies Cantor's set theory. Cantor's set theory is required to give Godel reflections of theories past omega. It doesn't justify all the metaphysics, however, just the ordinals past the integers.\nAs you go up the ordinal list, the ordinals are ever more complicated computer programs (each ordinal is a \"process\" in Paul Cohen's words). Traditionally, you can define the limit of all ordinals that can be represented on a computer within a set theory, and this is called the Chuch-Kleene ordinal. You can only approach the Church-Kleene ordinal in complexity.\nFurther development\nAfter Godel, Gentzen proved the consistency of Peano Arithmetic within a very limited axiomatic system (PRA--- a weak fragment of PA) with the additional assumption\n\nThe ordinal epsilon-naught is well founded\n\nFrom this point on, it was clear that consistency proofs of complicated theories can be given from simple theories with the only complex assumption the well-foundedness of a certain countable computable ordinal. For PA, the ordinal wasn't even all that complicated, so that there are questions (like the Paris-Harrington problem, or the hydra problem, or Goodstein's theorem) that are equivalent to the well-foudedness of epsilon-naught, and so cannot be proved within PA, but which are equivalent to the consistency of PA, so they are provable in any theory that can prove the consistency of PA.\nThe subject of ordinal proof theory attempts to match an ordinal, as explicitly describable as possible, to each mathematical theory. This program has has success with certain set theories, and there is no barrier for it proving the consistency of any theory, no matter how infinite. So another implication is\n\nIt is possible to complete Hilbert's program, and prove the consistency of uncountably infinite mathematical systems, only using countable computable ordinals which can be represented on a computer.\n\nThis program is active today, but it has still not proved the consistency of ZF. Partly this is because many people continue to say that this cannot be done, because of Godel's theorem.\nThe main assumption in these ideas is that the process of producing ordinals which approach the Church Kleene ordinal can be somehow understood, although it is not formalizable as a computer program. This process is a gain in complexity analogous to biological evolution, and how far we can go within our human limitations is not understood.\nFalse implications\nThere are many false implications of Godel's theorem\n\nWe are more than computers\n\nThis interpretation comes from the fact that we can understand that a program P doesn't halt (namely SPITE for a given formal system) even though the formal system can't. To see that this is a false conclusion, you just have to look at what SPITE does: it simulates the system, looks for the prediction, and spites it! There is no reason you can't do that to a person:\n\nIf you can simulate a person, you can predict their choice, and spite their decision--- so that you can place a million dollars in box A only if the person will choose box B.\n\nThis is the exact analog of Godel's theorem in the human realm, and it is a famous philosophical problem. There are also statements\n\nJohn Searle cannot consistently believe this statement\n\nthat are exactly analogous, and that John Searle cannot believe, although it is true. Although to make it a first-order logic statement about arithmetic, you have to give a computational model of Searle's beliefs, which might not be possible due to the randomness. But the idea is the same--- the things the axiom system cannot know, but we can know, are things about the system itself.\nThere are further constructions due to Chaitin, which rephrase the incompleteness theorem as follows\n\nNo program can prove that any string has Kolmogorov complexity greater than the length of the program plus a fixed constant\n\nBut in a computational view of people, this just means that no human can prove that a string has Kolmogorov complexity greater than the complexity of a program which simulates this human. Since we have such a hard time even with small Kolmogorov complexity, this is a safe prediction.\nSo there are no consequences of Godel's theorem that imply that the computational theory of mind is false. There are other ideas\n\nGodel's theorem says semantics isn't formalizable\n\nThis is not exactly true either--- Godel's theorem says that the semantics of halting computer programs is only approximately axiomatizable by strengthening systems, and the process of strengthening is non-algorithmic at the high end. But the precise nature of the non-algorithmicness might be a simple as naming ever larger computable countable ordinals that approach the Church Kleene ordinal, and this might be evolutionarily possible in a reasonable way.\n\nGode's theorem kills Hilbert's program\n\ninasmuch as Hilbert's program developed ordinal analysis in response to Godel's theorem, this is not true. It does make a naive implementation of Hilbert's program impossible, but the ordinal analysis view is not at all naive, and is precisely the kind of foundations one can expect for mathematics which is infinitely rich and infinitely complex.\n"}]}

I'm not sure anyone has published any major criticisms of his arguments. In a way, he's attempting to rescue the idea of objectivity, to rehabilitate truth and the notion of the subject, from the ontological criticisms set forth by the theorists who came before. It's a breath of fresh air for those who think of Deleuze as a \"dead-end\", not necessarily to be read as a contradiction of that work.\nThe specific criticisms, as I understand them, would probably go something as follows:\n\nBadiou continuously ignores and even refuses to recognize the \"suppleness\" of power, and its effect on the discourse of alterity. He says that the association of pathos with these forms of alterity is both disruptive and unnecessary, and even attempts to remove alterity and pathos from the equation entirely through the use of mathematical axioms, but this is impossible. Despite the claims made in his works, he is still haunted by an \"ineradicable remainder of pathos\". Here, you can read the entire earlier works of Emmanuel Levinas (to which Badiou is responding) as themselves indictments of Badiou. \nSlavoj \u017di\u017eek is also a critic in some senses (though he possesses an extreme amount of respect for Badiou's thought, describing him as a \"giant who walks among us\" and likening him to Plato or Hegel), with the primary point of divergence being \u017di\u017eek's allegiance to Kant and Hegel, contrasted with Badiou's rejection of both. \u017di\u017eek is very much on the side of \"finitude\", whereas Badiou attempts to overcome the very problem of finitude. In particular, though Badiou accuses the philosopher's \"denial of enjoyment\" as making her vulnerable to asceticism, the philosopher can in turn accuse the psychoanalyst (Badiou) as being transfixed by his own enjoyment, particularly since Badiou's argument is that contemporary culture exists almost entirely \"under the emblem of enjoyment\". Specifically, Bruno Bosteels makes this observation in an article he contributed to Alain Badiou: Key Concepts, edited by Bartlett and Clemens. (Although Bosteels is attempting to clarify and synergize the works of the two theorists, rather than strictly offering a criticism of Badiou.)\nGilles Deleuze (and, to a lesser extent, his good buddy, F\u00e9lix Guattari) is probably Badiou's primary antagonist. Although both interpret philosophy as involving the thinking of the multiplicity, Deleuze stubbornly refuses to give in to Badiou's willingness to cede the thinking of enjoyment to the psychoanalyst. The primary author to consider here is Deleuze's student and contemporary, Eric Alliez. Suggested readings might include his essay \"Badiou: the Grace of the Universal\" and his contributions to the above-suggested title, Alain Badiou: Key Concepts.\nGiorgio Agamben also opposes Badiou in his insistence upon the \"irreducible remainder\". In essence, he argues that the ethic of truth proposed by Badiou actually requires the \"occlusion of the remainder\", and Agamben's entire understanding of philosophical discourse rests on the potentiality of the remainder, primarily through his central concept of \"bare life\", which can be interpreted as life which is resting on the very verge of death.\n\n"}]}

These two cultures overlap only in me, which could hardly be said to constitute a community. One could say that, where relevant, each person had his own, individual culture: but that would defeat the purpose of the theory of cultural relativism, which suggests that people's opinions are influenced by their peers.\nIt would seem best to say that each person is part of several distinct cultures at once. Each of them influences his opinions. Sometimes these influences would lead to contradictory opinions; in that case, he may be under stronger influence from one culture than from the others, leading to his accepting it and rejecting the others; alternatively, both influences may be equally strong, resulting in his being torn and undecided.\nThe hypochondriac lesbian dominatrix in me feels that gay marriage should be accepted: the Catholic in me disagrees. The influence of my lesbian friends might trump that of my Catholic family, or vice versa; or I might go see a shrink because I am nonplussed.

Consider Wittgenstein's insight that what constitutes a \"game\" is best compared to a family of internally related things, rather than a group of things that all share a fixed set of properties. Similarly, \"liberal\" denotes a group of people, but they probably do not all share the same properties. Some might merely be economic liberals, while others are only socially liberal.

For members of contemporary \"modern\" societies, there seems to be a problem that does not arise for the members of isolated and homogeneous groups. \nWe all are members of multiple cultures at one time.

On at least some moral issues, these various cultural affiliations will pull in different directions. For instance, overall, Canadian culture supports same sex marriage, Catholic culture does not, and support for same sex marriage is lower in the Prairie provinces (such as Manitoba) then the more populous provinces. \nSo, how do proponents of the Cultural Relativist Thesis respond to the difficulty that, for most people in the world, there is no one unique culture to which they belong and that the various cultures to which a person belongs may provide both the verdicts of \"right\" and of \"wrong\" for some particular actions?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cultural relativity is more easily understood if you realize that it isn't about \"right\" and \"wrong\" but about \"appropriate\" and \"inappropriate\".

Of course, we never actually speak of one person owning another person meaning any of these things, because that is slavery.  But it's pretty hard to say what would be ethical with regards to sentient machines without more details, e.g. do we keep sentient machines as pets, are they our household servants, what exactly is sentience, do we all live as equals, are we at war with them, can they build copies of themselves, are they dependent on us for survival?  Even with a specific definition of \"ownership\", the answer depends on the relationships they have with us, which are presumably different from the relationships we have with ourselves.\nFor example, imagine that a program running on my computer has suddenly become sentient.  If I turn the computer off, or allow it to lose power through inaction, I could be convicted of murder.  If I leave the computer on forever, I will have to pay money for all that power.  If nobody knows that my computer is running a sentient process, and unless I'm interested in having a prolonged discussion with it, should I unplug the computer as soon as possible to save money, hoping to get away with the crime?  There is a parallel to the issues of abortion and contraception.

Yet honor is in trouble today. Dishonorable behavior is rampant, to be sure, but we are also confused about honor, about what it is and what it is not. Honor may well be ubiquitous, but the concept of honor is not well understood, either by those who live within honor groups or by those who view themselves as rising above any culture of honor. . . . [M]y account of honor aims at something even more ambitious than descriptive clarity with potentially universal scope (as if that weren't ambition enough!). By exhibiting honor as a normative concept, I hope we might come to see its value for us as well as for others. My account is therefore a philosophical rarity, for philosophers today share the general academic distaste for honor. For most Western academics, honor is a moral pariah, a concept recognized as important to others though not an idea to be taken seriously in one's own life.  . . . [T]here has been no serious normative examination of the concept of honor as such. It seems that philosophers, like other academics, are not much interested in honor as a living value in our society today.\n\nThe publisher's description bills it as \"the first contemporary philosophical inquiry into the concept of honor.\" Sessions himself says that, \"Since the late 19th century, there have been no major philosophical studies of honor. Philosophers have occasionally written narrowly on academic honor systems, deprecating honor as obsolete and a tribal virtue at best, but not as a major subject for a book.\" He claims that, in fact, honor has received a \"bad reputation\" that is \"not entirely undeserved,\" considering all the harm that it has caused in the world. He specifically cites examples ranging from terrorism to honor killings. \nBut he opines that the problem really stems from a pervasive misunderstanding of honor, and that the concept is sorely in need of \"clarification.\" Many philosophers seem to wish to \"discard honor altogether as 'obsolete',\" when in reality, the \"notion of honor remains viable in the face of powerful criticism . . . and has important features which warrant our normative interest.\" \nHis philosophical project in the book is to identify six different concepts of honor, which he says are useful in an attempt to make sense out of chaotic situations. These concepts include:\n\nConferred honor (or reputation)\nRecognition honor (which honors excellence)\nPositional honor (being placed higher than others in society)\nCommitment honor (honoring a principle or ideal)\nTrust honor (honoring a person, including his/her word)\nPersonal honor\n\nAnd in fact, he thinks that the sixth central concept of honor\u2014personal honor\u2014is the most important.\nInterestingly enough, much of the book's inspiration seems to have come from an undergraduate philosophy course that Sessions has taught on honor since 1999.\n"}]}

Category one questions abound: \"Is there a God\" is both philosophical (concerning fundamental metaphysical questions) and theological (concerning the nature and existence of a god).\nAs I see it, a question is not philosophical if it assumes a philosophical framework. As an example, if I ask you \"Is Brad Pitt a good actor?\" I'm assuming that we share a philosophical framework in which we agree that Brad Pitt exists, that he is an actor, and that there is some standard by which we can judge some actors as good and others as not good, and that it is ethical for us to make that judgement.\nThis question is also not theological: the existence and nature of one or several deities is not really relevant to the question.\nA trickier question might be \"Does Zeus think Brad Pitt is a good actor?\" I'm not sure that this is a theological question, because it sort of assumes that the theological issue of the existence of Zeus and our ability to know his opinions vis-a-vis Brad Pitt is settled. We could argue that the opinions of Zeus should be important to us, so, theologically, if we worship Zeus and Zeus favors Brad Pitt, we should all watch more Brad Pitt movies to gain favor with Zeus. In that case, this question would be theological but not philosophical, the question of \"what is good acting\" isn't relevant, because Zeus may have one opinion on this matter and Hera another. \nAn even trickier question would be \"Does God (as in the ultimate arbiter of everything God) think Brad Pitt is a good actor?\" If God the ultimate arbiter of everything in the universe thinks Brad Pitt is a good actor, than this defines what good acting is in reality, so the question is really \"What is good acting?\". In a sense, this makes any question concerning Omni-God and art a fundamental question of Aesthetics.\nSo it seems that depending on the nature of the theology in question, it is either trivial or difficult to ask a question that is theological in nature but not philosophical, but nothing precludes that such questions can exist.\n"}]}

The problem comes when examining the content of his logical argument.  What he suggests by his demonstration is that of course there are material objects: we can feel them and see them and interact with them.  But if Bishop Berkeley objected that the sensation of feeling, seeing and interacting with objects could simply be the result of, for instance, imagination, Dr. Johnson would need to deal directly with that objection.  (I don't know either if Bishop Berkeley made such an objection or if Dr. Johnson offered a response, but for the sake of the illustration, let's assume the first did and the later didn't.)\nIt's not always incorrect to use arguments that are in the form of logical fallacies, as the example of kicking a stone illustrates.  For most of us, the simple demonstration is effective at getting the point across.  But when you consider the opposite viewpoint, ad lapidem does not satisfy an objection or compel agreement.  It may be useful for scoring points in a debate, but not useful in either finding common ground or discovering the truth.  Pointing out a fallacious argument should redirect the proponent of the position to try another method of arguing that does not entail a logical fallacy.\nDr. Johnson could have corrected his argumentum ad lapidem (and perhaps he did) by suggesting some other reason not to accept immaterialism.  \n"}]}

Strictly speaking, Einstein was both a lover of knowledge (the literal meaning of \"philosopher\") and a deep, effective abstract thinker.  Naively, one might imagine that a genius in one field will be at least a standout in any other field that requires similar mental ability.\nSadly, that is not so.  Consider, for instance, the theology of Isaac Newton.  Newton must be seen as the equivalent of Einstein when it comes to physics.  Swap their places chronologically, and it's entirely possible they would have been capable of making each other's discoveries in physics and in mathematics.  Like Einstein, Newton avidly thought of the \"big picture\".  Most people would be severely tempted to accept his thought on any topic up-to and including philosophy.\nBut Newton's theological ideas were mostly unknown in his own time (because of the threat of being tried for heresy) and as they are unearthed and examined with modern eyes, seem bizarre and unscientific.  While it makes sense that a man so instrumental in calculating the past and future position of heavenly bodies would be interested in calculating the times of the start and end of the world according to arcane prophesies, almost nobody (Christian or not) would agree with any of his conclusions.  In a sense, his approach to teasing out the mysteries of physics and solving the problems of calculus proved wholly inappropriate to teasing out the mysteries of the Bible and solving the problems of prophesy.\nI suspect that in time, Einstein will join the ranks of scientists who were considered out of their depths in philosophy and other fields.  The list would include Pythagoras (philosopher, mathematician, and founder of the religious movement called Pythagoreanism), Johannes Kepler (mathematician, astronomer and astrologer), Tycho Brahe (astronomer and alchemist), and of course Isaac Newton (physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist, and theologian).1  That's not a slight on these great thinkers, but a warning that we ought not take all their ideas as words from on high.\nOn a more personal and anecdotal note: scientists seem to dedicate themselves to intense study within their field and are often somewhat ordinary thinkers in unrelated fields.  It may be that the technological and mathematical demands of modern science make becoming a contributor in multiple fields more difficult than in the past.  For reference, I learned the Pythagorean theorem in 6th grade, much of Newton's contribution to physics and math in high school, and struggled through Einstein's work in college.  Considering the equivalent progress required to be an expert philosopher (and student of philosophy), it seems less likely than ever before that we will discover true polymaths in this era.\n\nFootnote:\n\nAll descriptions taken from each thinker's respective Wikipedia page.\n\n"}]}

This is obscured by several historical fictions which Polanyi dispels with evidence.\n\nI want to recall how scientific theory came to be reduced in the modern mind to the rank of a convenient contrivance, a device for recording events and computing their future course, and I wish to suggest then that twentieth-century physics, and Einstein's discovery of relativity in particular, which are usually regarded as the fruits and illustrations of this positivistic conception of science, demonstrate on the contrary the power of science to make contact with reality in nature by recognizing what is rational in nature.

At a time like the present, when experience forces us to seek a newer and more solid foundation, the physicist cannot simply surrender to the philosopher the critical contemplation of the theoretical foundations; for, he himself knows best, and feels more surely where the shoe pinches.

That way, they can easily be defined and be consistent with God's intervention.  In this way it is impossible to violate the laws of nature because they are simply a definition of how nature is, whether or not God is causing the behaviour.\nSo, the idea of God is not, I believe, logically impossible.  It is certainly possible that a God could exist that is omnipotent and omniscient, and logically impossible statements don't change that.  What can be said for sure, though. is that if such a God exists, it is an extremely nasty God (by human standards).  It is a God that has the power to end suffering, yet does not.  It is a God that has the power to give every human an equal opportunity to discover it, yet it does not; in fact, it gives some humans a one-way ticket to heaven (the ones born into a strong culture of indoctrination into belief in the God), and other humans a one-way ticket to hell (the ones born into a strong culture of indoctrination into beliefs in another God/Gods).

The more that I drink of it, the more certain I am of its truth.\"  The fount could be just about anything: communism, fundamentalism, Freud, etc.  It could also be a set of varied belief systems as long as they exclude other belief systems.  (I recall a professor in college who was known for his \"Marxist feminism\" stance.)  What matters to a modernist is that there does exist some set of beliefs that are demonstrably true.  It's difficult to describe modernists without resorting to caricature, because many of the ideas that have been attached with modernism have been discredited by postmodernists.\nPostmodernists suggest that this isn't a single source of wisdom or that we can't have access to it or that each person has their own source or, well, whatever objections a person might find to the modernist standpoint.  Ultimately, postmodernism stands for the idea that different sources of truth must be allowed to coexist in our society.  It's easy to discover the influences (and sometimes conflicts) of postmodernism if you examine the position of religion in public over the last 100 or so years.  Western religions usually assert a single source of truth and so are increasingly required to take a back seat in many forms of public expression.\nIf you happen to be a programmer, you might find this talk by Larry Wall as helpful as I have.

Nor will any of them be correct.\nI could tell you that \"postmodernist\" thought is generally characterized by a \"rejection of objective Truth\", and a strong suspicion towards \"totalizing meta-narratives\", but that probably wouldn't tell you very much. And it wouldn't be strictly accurate, either. I could tell you that it argues that many of the things which we take for granted are merely \"social constructions\", not merely figments of our imagination, but things that we as a society have indeed created for ourselves. I could say that it aims to expose and destroy oppressive systems of classification, particularly those that emphasize sharp divisions between groups\u2014gender, race, culture, etc. But one of those things might give you the idea that it's somehow \"pluralism\", which is so completely wrong that I'm not even sure where to begin.\nThe reality is that \"postmodernism\" is not something that you can define, at least not as applied to philosophy. There were hardly any notable philosophers who accepted the label of \"post-modernist\", and many of those who are often considered to be anchors of the tradition actually strictly rejected the label.\nPart of the problem, of course, is highlighted by Jon Ericson's answer: thinking that is typically associated with the \"postmodern\" camp seeks to reject things like labels and totalizing meta-narratives. They wouldn't be too keen on allying themselves with any particular camp, or labeling their unique brand of thought as \"postmodernist\". There is a notable tendency among these thinkers to resist the homogenization and categorization that such labeling implies.\nAbout the only thing you can accurately say about \"postmodernism\" is that it's characterized by a rejection of modernism, the pseudo-scientific mentality of progressive objectivity established in the Enlightenment. Truly, one could argue that without the Enlightenment and the resulting movement that has become known as \"modernism\", there could never be such thing as \"post-modernism\". But whether that's actually a useful definition or merely a linguistic tautology is debatable.\nAnd even if you accept that definition, a couple of problems still remain. First, it's extremely difficult to define something in terms of what it is not. Several notable \"postmodernist\" thinkers have taken up this very notion, albeit in quite different contexts. As merely one example, consider Jacques Lacan and his notion of the \"lack\". Second, several of those who are apparently \"postmodernist\" thinkers have actually accepted \"modernist\" notions to varying degrees. J\u00fcrgen Habermas in particular is very much a \"modernist\", and he doesn't even reject the notions of \"universality\" and \"Truth\" that seem to characterize the thought of most other \"postmodernists\". It's hard to say whether \"postmodernity\" actually seeks to replace modernity, to render it obsolete, or whether it merely allied with it, continuing and reinvigorating the modernist project.\nMany, many, many \"postmodernist\" scholars vehemently disagree with one another. Somehow, this camp has grown to contain post-Marxists, feminists, deconstructionists, anarchists, post-Freudian psychoanalysts, and everything else outside and in between. Many people use it as a label of denigration, or at least a nicer way of saying \"those people\", the \"different\" ones, the ones \"we\" don't agree with. You see this in an unfortunate amount of academic literature, and in an even more unfortunate amount of colloquial rhetoric. See, for example, Paul Hartman's \"What is 'Postmodernism'?\" or the infamous Postmodernism Generator (refresh repeatedly for a real thrill!). In a truly postmodern sense, its accuracy lies in its appalling inaccuracy.\nSo yes, of course it has a fuzzy definition, and of course the Wikipedia article seems to characterize it in terms of what it is not. There's not much else that it can do. In fact, reading the Wikipedia article now, it strikes me as possibly one of the best attempts to clarify and define the movement that I've ever seen. And I've read a whole lot of so-called \"postmodernist\" literature.\nBeyond that, the paragraph you mention concluding that postmodernism has influenced many other cultural fields is an important one. \"Postmodernism\" is not limited in scope to philosophy. In fact, when applied to other disciplines, an even more complicated web begins to emerge. From architecture to art to music, and dozens of other disciplines in between, \"postmodernism\" takes on very important meanings. Wikipedia links to a host of articles on \"postmodern x\", where x represents some particular artistic discipline. Again, what most of them have in common is the rejection of \"modernism\"\n\"Postmodernists\" would tell you that you're really asking the wrong question. Rather than trying to put a label on their critical project, to attempt to unite and thereby destabilize it from without, you should join in on the project and become part of the movement.\nIf \"postmodernism\" implies anything at all, it implies problematization, the refusal to tacitly accept anything as objectively true, as objectively real, as objectively valuable. That doesn't, of course, mean that it embraces skepticism. That doesn't mean that it necessarily rejects all notions of objective truth. But it does mean that the goal is to problematize everything, to attempt to see everything from a different light, to root out problems at their source, to emphasize connections that haven't been previously observed or noted, to engage in relations with other cultures, values, practices, and systems of thought. It's a critical project, one in which nothing is taken as absolute, including the idea that nothing is an absolute.\n"}]}

Perhaps it is one of the arguments to support the philosophical independence .\nGenerally, I agree with what most of the people here said, but I need to expound it further. Empirical inquiry does not solely refer to natural sciences if we are talking about moral philosophy. When we say Empirical or scientific inquiry, we simply refer to a meta-ethical justification stating that physical feelings can correspond to a certain moral value. Thus, hedonism and utilitarianism are forms of empirical justifications, because it equates goodness with pleasures. In a first glimpse, we cannot see any absurdity in that. After all if we are all satisfied, everything is good.\nBut ethical non-naturalism challenges this ethical justification. Ethical non-naturalism argues that combining pleasures and satisfactions cannot constitute to anything aside from being pleasurable. As such, the term \"good\" is not a physical property, rather it is an irreducible component of a particular action. Thus, an action should satisfy a certain objective standard  to deductively justify the intrinsic goodness of an action. This means that the term good is not empirical and is not synonymous to pleasures, because we will still ask what made pleasures good or right?I am not saying that hedonism is wrong. I am just saying sciences can use hedonism  to make morality entirely empirical. But it failed because goodness is not an empirical property.\nThere are also other attempts to make morality scientific, one of which is through psychology. It argues that  external influences shape our moral convictions. According to these people, mind sciences give a better view about morality. However, these sciences only discuss the \"motivation to act\", and not cannot justify an action. Suppose that a person killed a rabbit, mind scientists would assert that a person did that because there are some uncontrollable impulses that forced that person. But this does not account for any moral value. Is it immoral or moral? Therefore, mind sciences only compliments moral philosophy after it has justified the value of an action. it is sound to say that John became immoral, because his peers are likewise, because we have defined immorality. But it is absurd to say that John is influenced by his peers to kill, thus killing is immoral.\n"}]}

Let's take the example of gravity. A theory of gravity is a theory that (very loosely speaking) answers the question \"How do up and down work?\".\nBut what if someone said, \"I don't agree with your definition of 'up', or 'down', or 'direction'? I think all those things are subjective and that there's no reason to privilege your definition of 'up'?\"\nAnd the answer is that of course it wouldn't matter, because whatever word you used to describe \"down\", the phenomena of down would still be observable and measurable and you could make predictions about it and so forth.\nHarris takes the position that \"morality\" relates to the well being of conscious creatures. You can take the position that you don't agree that morality relates to the well being of conscious creatures, but arguing semantics doesn't change the underlying phenomena.\nMuch like \"up\" or \"down\", the well being of conscious creatures is measurable, observable, and you can make predictions about what will promote it and what will not. So you can say \"Harris isn't talking about morality, he's talking about wellbeing\" and that's fine. He's at least talking about something.\nNow, you could have an alternate definition of morality, and if that definition also focused on observable and measurable things, you would also be able to scientifically demonstrate what would and would not be moral. And if there's no consensus definition of morality, that's a bit of a problem for Harris.\nFor example, if I defined \"good\" as \"there are sheep and cows, but more sheep than cows\", then any action can be measured against whether it promotes the future existence of sheep and cows but ensures that there are always more sheep.\nSo we might ask why one definition of \"good\" is better than another. The answer that Harris gives is that, when it comes right down to it, people are always talking about wellbeing when they talk about morality. His claim is that he's just using the concept at the core of every definition.\nWhether that is true or not is in some ways irrelevant. Harris concedes that you have to agree with his basic assumption that a state of universal, maximal suffering is maximally and universally undesirable for his argument to work.  Anyone who brings up, say, the \"is-ought\" problem is rejecting this premise. I mean, fine. They've rejected his definitions. That isn't the same as addressing the argument. It isn't useful.\n"}]}

(We like to think they do since it saves arguing about whether X is worth achieving, which ends up with the realization that we don't have a satisfyingly solid grounding for knowledge, etc..)\nUnfortunately, Sam Harris doesn't really delve into the issue adequately; rather than making a spirited defense of the value of contingent oughts like e.g. Daniel Dennett does, he just expresses his feeling that of course science can tell you what you ought to do.  (And not in a very impressive way, either--he starts with really clear cases where everyone agrees what to do and notes that adding a scientific perspective doesn't change anything, and then as far as I can tell dismisses the rest as details.)\nInstead, it would have been nice if he had brought to bear the full force of contingency, including extinction if you screw up too badly.  Harris' personal views seem to be very typically American--highly individualistic and happiness-based, in particular--which may explain in part why he didn't go in that direction.  Happiness is great and all, and it's nice not to worry about people telling you what to do.  But when one starts from \"we're intelligent social primates in an indifferent and largely deadly universe\", it's hard to get to a point where you don't start thinking it could potentially be a good idea to curtail individual freedoms to maintain environmental sanity, and that we should probably demand a much higher degree of attention to nurturing our offspring to enable them to make informed decisions about this complicated technological society we've built.\n(Someone needs to write a book titled \"Your Feelings are Trying to Make You Evolutionarily Fit in a Social Context\".)\nAnyway, I view the is/ought divide as probably much ado about nothing; I think when we end up fully exploring the force of contingent oughts, we may have enough.

Please don't dismiss everything just because I don't have enough evidence to backup my points because proving any theory comes after the theory, and before theory comes mere speculation.\nYes it is but only if you use purely logical definitions of the words \"good\" and \"evil\" and exclude emotions and opinions from determining what is good and evil. For a non opinionated, non-emotional answer to even be possible, we have to consider evil as being the opposite of good and only consider intention (or law of physics), not end result.\nWhat really is good and evil (short answer)\n\nGood = pure selflessness\nEvil (ungood, not necessarily wicked) = pure selfishness or more accurately, pure lack of selflessness\n\nNB This is not based on emotion, but the theory and logic that I have explained in the long answer below.\nWhat really is good and evil (long answer with logical explanation)\n\nGood = consciousness\nEvil (ungood, not necessarily wicked) = material\n\nIf you define \"evil\" as being wicked, then this is not possible, as what constitutes being wicked is purely a matter of opinion. If we define \"evil\" as being the opposite of good, then we have something logical we can work with. The opposite of good is \"goodless\" or \"ungood\", not wicked. Therefore the word \"evil\" is ambiguous. Evil can't mean both \"wicked\" and the opposite of good, otherwise the opposite of light would not be dark. To avoid this ambiguity and so that we have something logical we can work with, I'll refer to \"evil\" as \"goodless\". Neither \"goodless\" or \"ungood\" are in the dictionary, however, it's more important to use words with the right meaning, than the wrong words just because they are in the dictionary.\nIf you exclude consciousness, the laws of physics describe \"goodless\". The second law of thermodynamics, \"In a closed system, the entropy always stays the same or increases\". A closed system is simply a system without consciousness, and entropy is chaos. One way of looking at it, is without good, things either stay the same or become more chaotic. All the laws of physics that describe the material world describe \"goodless\". Therefore, all material on it's own is goodless, and the laws of physics already describe its behaviour.\nThe laws of physics do not describe \"good\" though. Considering ungood = material, good must mean the opposite of material and be described by laws of physics that are the opposite of what describe \"ungood\". That's because the laws of physics do not describe consciousness. Some people live in a messy environment because they lack the conscious effort to keep it tidy but how many people live in a messy environment because they put a conscious effort in to intentionally create a mess? That was just a simply example but the same is true with much more complicated mess that we are not always aware of. Consciousness always seeks to lower chaosness. A computer without consciousness, is purely ungood, and that includes our brains too. The laws of consciousness are the exact opposite of the laws of physics describing material. Material is finite, consciousness is infinite. The entropy increases on its own without consciousness, the entropy decreases with consciousness. It's similar to electricity taking the path of least resistance. It's as if electricity is consciously aware of it's circuits and to avoid increasing entropy, it takes the path of least resistance. On it's own consciousness does not have free will. How can it, considering it's impossible for it to break the laws of consciousness and seek to intentionally create overall chaoticness? When consciousness increases entropy, it's because its being manipulated by something that is not conscious. A persons consciousness may control their brain but their consciousness will only act on what information it has. Therefore, a persons brain, can manipulate the persons consciousness, and considering it only cares about balancing emotions, why wouldn't it? Selflessness, only comes from consciousness, and selfishness is simply a lack of consciousness. We have freewill because we have a purely selfish brain that's manipulates our purely selfless consciousness and vice versa. People can do wicked things when they have a weak soul and a corrupt brain, but their soul is still pure good, and their brain pure ungood. They can't exist without each other.\nThis doesn't mean we should all become pacifists by avoiding chaos in order to be good. For example, long term it may be far less chaotic fighting for your rights, despite the immediate chaos. When is war ever the right thing? Simply when its the most peaceful option long term which is very rare. Self defence, protect the oppressed etc may justify it but never personal gain or money.\nHow it relates to morality and the justice system\nAs for morality, as described in the article, I think people just need to think about the differences between justice and revenge. Killing or locking up a murderer is an act of revenge, if you do it because you think they deserve it. However, of course they should at least be locked up but for logical reasons, not emotional ones. There are two reasons. One, they can't kill innocent people behind bars, and two, to reduce the likely hood of other people committing murders. How we should treat those that do wrong can't be described by science because the extent you should go to depends largely on variables, such as how effective is the punishment and how much it deters others from doing the same. You also have to consider the well being of those that are punished and decide what is better for everyone as a whole. For something very serious like child rape, their well being becomes insignificant. It's logical to make them suffer for their entire life if it reduces the chance of others doing the same but for minor crimes like shoplifting, its not so clear. Surely it's better a shop goes out of business from losing money due to shoplifting, than to eliminate it eliminate theft by making thieves afraid to be tortured. When the fear of making mistakes is worse than the consequences to everyone of making those mistakes, you're doing more harm than good.\nHow does it relate to religion?\nIt doesn't if you take things literally. You have to think in metaphors. Why would God create the devil? Consciousness can't exists without a physical universe otherwise there would be nothing to be conscious of. Good creates evil so that good can exist. Since consciousness seeks to reduce entropy, it has to exist to be able to reduce entropy. It doesn't need to exist at the time of the big bang though. The zero point energy field interacts with everything past, present and future through quantum fluctuations. All it would take for quantum fluctuations to create our universe so precisely, is the ability to make nothingness fluctuate and a brain to make the calculations with. Outside of space time, cause doesn't come before effect. Before and after become irrelevant and you are just left with infinite possibilities. It might sound paradoxical an all knowing consciousness using it's brain so that it can create a brain to figure out if and how it should create a universe to evolve into a brain, but it's not because no laws of physics are broken. It just needs two things to be possible. For nothingness to be able to fluctuate, (quantum fluctuations) and to use the information from quantum fluctuations. The former is a necessity for evolution to occur. Evolution requires fluctuations. The latter only needs to be possible to be possible. If it's possible to be possible, then the universe can exist to make it possible to exist and decide that it should exist, provided it will do what it takes to make it possible and no laws of physics are broken, it's a possibility. It gives everything a purpose because for the universe to function as a brain, it requires to stars to be alive, which requires living planets, such as Earth. Earth is only alive because it has life on it. Our purpose could be to spread life to other planets.\n"}]}

Clearly, this science would be extremely difficult to realize in practice (having to take every ramification in the universe of every action into account?!) - but is it theoretically sound?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The very short answer is:  No.  The longer answer is to explain Harris's five mistakes:\n\nHarris starts with the mistaken view of \"scientism\" that all knowledge is scientific knowledge.  But we have multiple fields of study, including fine arts,  humanities, and areas of practical skills (engineering, technical, medical, organizational, etc) that are not \"science\".  He therefore invalidly assumes that if we can arrive at any shared knowledge of a moral question, that makes morality a \"scientific\" question.\nHarris is further confused about what and how science, is, and operates.  Science is an EXPLORATION process, not a bookkeeping one.  Science investigations go through a set of stages:  Exploration of a subject; speculation on its key features; informed exploration to better understand those features; postulating hypotheses; testing, then revising those hypotheses based on test results; development, then testing of formal theories; formalization of definitions and methodologies to solve most problems in the field.  Harris's method does not fit into any of these stages of scientific inquiry, nor does he understand or include the crucial aspect of testing and falsification.  What Harris is doing is NOT science.\nHarris's key assumption set -- both the priority of consciousness/sentience, and the presumption of goodness, along with his concern over moral action in the first place, are incompatible with his deterministic reductive materialism. If consciousness is no more than the operation of specific mechanical structures, then it ISN'T important, and does not justify any morality.  And moral goodness -- is an abstract object, which is not material, and has no relevance in a a reductive material worldview.  And if we are all determined, none of this discussion matters anyway. Harris's entire subject and starting assumptions are irrelevant in his overall worldview.\nHarris pretends he is doing non-subjective morality, but he is explicitly using subjective opinion to try to motivate his readers to accept the reality of morality.  He is explicitly appealing to our moral sense, but then pretends one can then do morality without either justifying the validity of such an appeal, or making any further appeals.\nHarris's approach to morality is to assume both hendonism for an individual == good, and that good is and should be optimized through utilitarian calculus.  This has several problems:\n5a) Most moral thinkers believe that hedonism fails to capture the essence of morality.  Care for OTHERS, empathy, is a far more central concept than the maximization of pleasures or minimization of pains.  And WELFARE matters a lot more than pleasure or pain.  And the object of moral calculation is not obviously an individual.  From a  Darwinian perspective, it should be the species. OR, from a deep ecology perspective, it should be the entire biome -- Gaia.  From a social perspective, it should be the community. At any rate, there are lot of alternatives to hedonistic utilitarianism that most moral thinkers consider to better capture morality.\n5b) Utilitarian calculus -- simply does not work.  Even form a hedonistic framework, one CANNOT calculate the sum of pleasure and pain, or any choice.  Even if one excludes all other living things, and treats all humans as equal experiencers.  Add in the problem of scale of importance of a consciousness, and how to account for future lives, and the level of impossibility goes up by several degrees.  And then if one tries to switch to welfare -- that isn't measurable.  And adding in the other levels of objects to optimize for:  society, species, ecosystem, biome, galaxy -- the absurdity of Harris's project should be readily apparent.\n\nSo -- the long answer is NO, as well.\nBUT -- there is a way in which Harris has hit upon a partially valid point.  One CAN get from \"is to ought\", IF our intuitions about \"ought\" are valid, because those intuitions are an \"is\".  But to do this, one:\n\nFIRST has to establish an ontology in which consciousness and selves matter, and in which there are relevant moral choices to be made. Acceptance that abstract objects seem to be real, and that the \"hard problem of consciousness\" suggests that consciousness does not reduce, hence reductive materialism isn't valid, is all that is needed.  One can operate with a pragmatic openness to both the reality of consciousness and abstract objects, without commitment to a single ontology.\nSECOND one has to establish that intuitions of morality give valid information about morality.  There are two methods I have seen to do so.  Eusocial darwinian theory holds that eusocial species need to enforce common welfare, and evolution could reasonably used our moral intuitions to do so -- making moral intuitions valid at least up to the level of species.  Or, if one accepts that abstract objects exist, then a moral sense implies that it was evolved to detect a real object -- abstract morality.\nTHIRD, one then has to deal with the obvious contradictions in moral sense person/person and society/society.  The eusocial answer is that eusociality does not rely upon the details of a moral intuition, just its existence, hence lots of contradictory moral views are equally eusocially good.  The abstraction detection view would hold that our moral sense is weak, hence often in error, and one must integrate moral intuitions across large numbers of people and societies for them to be valid.  The combination of these two views would predict that societies could and would maintain objectively flawed moral systems to maintain social cohesion, and its members would tend to ignore their intuitive objections to the immorality (dogma trumps conscience).\n\nComplete these three steps, and one can then begin a study of objective morality based on \"is\".  This would not be a science yet, as the subject is far too immature, but could at some point emerge from philosophy as a new science.\n"}]}

We were both married to women who did not wish to have more children.  My friend commented to me that submitting to sterilization would be like killing his unborn and unconceived children.  As soon as he said it, I understood my own grief.  How could anyone choose between the idea that conceiving children brings more suffering into the world and the idea that not conceiving children denies them the benefits of existence?  \n(I should note in passing that we have both resolved our conundrum: his wife suddenly desired children and is now a wonderful mother, and I learned to sacrifice my desires for the needs of my wife and be content with our only son.)\nAs far as I see, the only way to chose would be to have a detailed accounting of the value of existence versus nonexistence and compare it to the negative value of suffering.  And there are a few other unobtainable figures you would need to be anything like accurate.  When you start to think of it in this way, it fails the smell test.  \nSinger seems to couch is argument as if it's a relatively new idea that arises from global climate change or the population explosion or whatever apocalypse is of the moment.  (I made the mistake of glancing at the comments of the original article.  What a cynical bunch!  I may be ashamed of my own generation.)  But it's not new at all.  One of our oldest texts is dedicated to the question:\n After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. And Job said:\n\n\u201cLet the day perish on which I was born,\n   and the night that said,\n  \u2018A man is conceived.\u2019\n Let that day be darkness!\n   May God above not seek it,\n   nor light shine upon it.\n Let gloom and deep darkness claim it.\n   Let clouds dwell upon it;\n   let the blackness of the day terrify it.\n ... \u201d\n\nJob goes on like this for a while and explores the horror of existence with his friend for many pages.  And here is the answer they arrive at:\n And the Lord said to Job:\n\n\u201cShall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty?\n   He who argues with God, let him answer it.\u201d\n\nAnd I think that's as good an answer as exists.  Whatever or whoever brought us into existence did so on its own terms and who are we to argue?\n\nXodarap asked in the comments:\n\nBut surely we do argue with God - every time we choose to have or not have sex, we're taking a stance on this issue, no?\n\nIn a word: no.  You have it all wrong.  That would be like suggesting that every time we take a journey or stay at home, we are taking a stance on the issue of Immaterialism.  Or perhaps more to the point, we can reject or accept Immaterialism completely independent of how we chose to spend our time.  Accepting it might slightly bias us toward staying at home (I imagine), but we wouldn't be rejecting our ideals by traveling to a distant country.\nHaving struggled with the question of physical reproduction, I would further suggest that anyone who includes Singer's suggestion as a factor in their decision is a fool and deserves their own fate.  I don't have any real argument for that, however.\n\nTangentially, the value of existence over nonexistence is a critical premise in the ontological argument for God.  As far as I can see, rejecting the premise is the simplest possible objection to the argument since it completely sidesteps the more difficult problem of whether the argument is itself valid.  \n"}]}

All of the higher, more complex structures that we have are assembled or expressed through these basic building blocks.\nAccording to this site, the elements can be defined as follows:\n\nEarth \u2013 The element of Earth represents the physicality and substance of our lives.  The Earth evokes images of dirt, rocks, mountains and stones.  At the human level, it implies a relationship to the physical foundations that underpin our existence:  our bodies, our planet, the food we eat, the exercise we do\u2026 all of the everyday physical factors.\nWater \u2013 The element of Water is linked to the mental aspects of our lives: the intellect, perception, sequential cognition, concentration emotions and memory.  Where the body forms the basis for the element of earth, this collection of mental attributes forms the basis of Water.\nAir \u2013 The context that surrounds us but which is normally invisible is our culture and our relationships with other sentient beings.  Where the first elements seem to express a single being, Air is the connection between multiple beings.  Politics, art, education and other group activities fall under the purview of Air.\nFire \u2013 The final primary element is Fire and that represents the actions that we take.  Choices, decisions, practices, rituals\u2026 these are the realm of Fire.  In this respect, it should be noted that Fire is an element that can be wielded both productively or destructively.  A campfire can bring warmth or cook food \u2013 the same fire can burn down a house or destroy a village.  Fire provides the essential feedback in the elemental process.\n\nI assume that this derives from Aristotle's four elements of the same names, which he first enumerated in his treatise, On Generation and Corruption. However, these actually appear to originate from an even earlier thinker, Empedocles of Acragas. Of course, I've never seen any documentation confirming this lineage with respect to the more modern school of elementalism. Modern science, of course, has dismissed these early theories about the origins of matter and replaced them with a much more complex list of elements, taking a slight detour at medieval alchemy along the way.\n"}]}

The paradox arises from the ambiguity of language, because we commonly use the same logical words \"if\", \"either\", \"or\", \"is\", \"true\" with informal meanings.  Consider the statement: \"it is either true that closing switch A causes the light to be on, or closing switch B causes the light to be on.\"  It uses almost the same words as the conclusion.  If the premise is also restated in terms of \"causation\", a non-logical term, then the entailment will no longer hold, and we should not expect it to because the meanings are no longer the same.\nSo one intuition is to try and replace logical connectives with non-logical words and see if it still makes sense.  I speculate that this works because in communication it serves no purpose to have two logically equivalent statements of different lengths: we interpret the shorter statement formally to mean what it says, and we interpret the longer formally- and tautologically-equivalent statement more liberally; when persons seemingly use more words than necessary to say what they mean, then we often rightly assume that they mean something else.\n"}]}

You are like one of the other people, a part of the world. The world is not a part of you. The world didn't start with you and will not end with you.\nOption 2: There is a physical, objective world beyond the mind, but it's not the one you are experiencing. You are in fact being induced to hallucinate this world instead of the real one. Probably because aliens somehow want to use your body as an energy source, even though that claim makes so scientific sense and is about the worst plot device ever. Nothing you do can break this illusion, there is no blue or red pill.\nOption 3: There is no physical world outside your mind, there is only you. You are alone and god.

If my understanding of this implied basis for praise is correct, I think the philosophical conundrum is this:\nIf one claims to know the reasons for an agent's actions (or at least that the agent brought about some outcome via action), can one claim to be entirely ignorant of reasons for an agent's inactions?\nPut one last way, can one gather information about an agent's reasons for actions such that:\n\nthe information informs one only about reasons for action,\nthe information states nothing whatsoever about reasons for inaction,\nany perceived actions provide no new information about the likelihood of future action/inaction,\nand any apparent inaction provides no new information to confirm/disconfirm the original information concerning reasons for action?\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the Neo-Platonic tradition of thought --highly influential on many religions of the world, notably Christianity --God is identified as the source of all and only good (all good things, and only good things).  Evil is not considered, in this view, to have its own metaphysical existence, it is only the absence of good.  \nOne of the dominant metaphors for this, dating back to Plato himself, is to picture God as the sun, good things as the sunlight, and anywhere that bad or evil holds sway as areas in the shadow. In that context, it is not inconsistent to thank the sun for the sunlight, but not to blame the sun for the shade.\nWhile most modern believers are not explicitly neo-Platonic, the influence of that view continues to have an impact on beliefs such as the seemingly paradoxical ones you just described.  You may not personally be persuaded by this metaphor, but hopefully it will help explain how and why believers can thank God for the good things, but not blame God for the bad ones.\n"}]}

This answer avoids question begging, an infinite regress of justification, and foundationalism. Also note that Plantinga's proper functionalist account of properly basic beliefs is not open only to theism. For instance, Plantinga grants that various sense perceptions are also properly basic, just as belief in God is. Finally, for an account of knowledge that blocks sceptical scenarios like the Cartesian demon and the infinite regress, I suggest investigating Timothy Williamson's position in Knowledge and Its Limits.\nMaybe you shouldn't care about sceptical scenarios too much. It's important to distinguish knowing some proposition P from knowing that you know some proposition P.

Basically, you can have first-order knowledge without even bothering about the second-order knowledge.\nAt least in Plantinga's flavor of \"reformed epistemology\", what counts as a \"properly basic belief\" is mostly determined by the proper functioning of your brain according to a \"design plan\". Basically, if you are functioning as you were designed to, you should know which of your beliefs are \"properly basic\". It's an externalist account, so you shouldn't expect to be able to tell infallibly \"from the inside\" which of your beliefs are basic. You might not know that you have a brain lesion, for instance.

As Risse points out:\n\nHarsanyi\u2019s theorem [...] implies the existence of certain coefficients for a given profile of utility functions, but for a different profile, we obtain different coefficients. However, a complete formulation of utilitarianism requires the multi-profile\nformat. For it is utilitarian doctrine that each person count equally. An explicit\nformulation of this claim would stipulate that the aggregation be indifferent\nbetween two distributions that only differ in terms of the distribution of the\noverall utility across persons. But such a condition must compare and thus\nrefer to several profiles at once and cannot be captured in the single-profile\nformat. Therefore, as discussed here, Harsanyi\u2019s theorem cannot make a complete case for utilitarian summation.  So we should think of Harsanyi\u2019s theo-\nrem as providing an argument for the summation method as such, while not\nimplying anything about the weights given to the individuals. An argument\nfor equality must then come from elsewhere.\n\n(Emphasis in original.)\nNor was that paper the first to notice the issue; Amartya Sen is a [far] more illustrious critic; as quoted by Mongin:\n\nthe lack of a multi-profile equivalent was part of Sen's objections\nto Harsanyi's approach. Let us briefly review the reasons for which he claimed\nthat the Impartial Observer and the Aggregation Theorems are not proper\naxiomatisations of utilitarianism.\n\nWhat is needed is an axiomatisation that (1)\npermits independent formulation of individual utilities, and (2) which has the\ninvariance property of having the set of ai [ = the weights given to the individuals\nin the utility sum] determined independently of the utility functions to be aggregated (and in particular having ai = 1) (1986, p 1124).\n\n[...]\nSen's point [(2)] here appears to be that the standard Aggregation Theorem takes the\n(n + 1)-utilities of the individuals and the social observer as given, and therefore\nmakes the weights a dependent on the chosen profile. That is, Harsanyi follows\nthe traditional Bergson-Samuelson approach to the \"social welfare function.\"\nWe agree with Sen that this is inappropriate for an axiomatisation of utilitarianism. One major reason that this is so is just alluded to at the end of Sen's\nquotation and can be made explicit as follows. In contrast with affine or weighted\nsum rules, which have been rarely defended in the tradition of ethics and political\nphilosophy, classical utilitarianism always involves uniform weights, be they\nequated to 1 - as in Bentham's sum rule - or to 1/n - as in the (also time-honoured) average utility rule, Harsanyi's own favourite. To go from the affine conclusion of the Aggregation Theorem to classical utilitarianism one must satisfy a symmetry requirement which cannot, strictly speaking, be stated in the language of single profiles.\n\nNow, it is actually possible to derive a multi-profile version of Harsanyi's theorem and Mogin proceeds to derive it, essentially relying on the welfarism axioms. Essentially, in this context, a mixture-preserving (MP) function replaces the NVM utility. However while this is technically an interesting result (and the author also discusses how it skirts Arrow's impossibility theorem), the issue is that it's not really a philosophical or factual leap because:\n\nMP representations of the\nindividuals' VNM preferences are cardinal in the sense of being unique up to\npositive affine transforms but not necessarily cardinal in the more relevant sense\nof measuring the intensity of preferences. [... And] evidence is by and large unfavourable to the claim that MP functions adequately measure preference differences, as independently revealed to the experimenter.\n\n"}]}

We then end up with the repugnant condition - that rather than having a small population very happy people, it would be better to have a much larger population of people living in terrible conditions (utility barely positive).\nThis is related to my question on why utilitarianism averages utility. \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Having read that other question, I think I understand the issue. I'll do my best without LaTeX, but this might not be pretty.\nSuppose we consider everyone's utility to be of equal value. The total utility of a population would be the sum of each person's utility, i.e. utility_total = utility_1 + utility_2 + ...\nBy the definition of arithmetic mean, we can see that utility_total = mean * number_of_people. So an equivalent definition of utility_total deals with the arithmetic mean.\nHere's where I think the confusion happens: utility_total does not deal only with the mean. It also includes the number of people. \nSo if adding this person would decrease the mean utility, that would be OK so long as net utility was increased. If their utility was positive, then it is guaranteed to increase net utility, so essentially the question \"should we bring person X into the world\" is just \"will person X have positive utility?\" Which (in your scenario) is independent of others' utilities, and so there is no problem.\nEDIT: to be clear, this is what is sometimes known as \"total utilitarianism\". There does exist a variant of utilitarianism which does consider solely the average utility. In its naive form, your criticism is valid. I think proponents usually have some sort of \"two-level\" thinking whereby they switch between total and average utilitarianism as necessary. \nTo the best of my knowledge, \"utilitarianism\" usually means \"total utilitarianism\", which is why I answered this question this way. If you were interested in a defense of average utilitarianism, let me know.\n\nEDIT 2: There are many possible solutions to the repugnant conclusion. So I'll give my favorite: there is no such thing as a life worth living.\nI like it partly for shock value, but it also makes a good point: there is a fundamental difference between \"this life is so good it requires you to be born\" and \"this life is so good it requires you to not die.\" I.e. once you've been born, moral laws apply to you which didn't apply before you were born.\n"}]}

For reference, my argument is based on Wittgenstein's observations in the Philosophical Investigations \u00a7193-\u00a7195.\nTo ask whether the proposition \n\n(P) This coin is fair\n\nis falsifiable is to confuse two pictures we have of coins. One is the picture we have of the coin as a symbol for all its future applications - that is to say the picture of a physical coin symbolizing an ideal random process that gives one of two results with 50-50 probability. The other picture is that of the coin as an actual physical object - e.g. made of copper, round, thin, liable to friction and tear.\nNow the proposition (P) adopts the first picture - the property 'fairness' refers to the symbolic understanding of the coin as encapsulating the whole of its future application (i.e. flips) as a random process giving one of two results with a 50-50 chance.\nOn the other hand, the following proposition\n\n(Q) Is P falisfiable?\n\nrefers to the second picture, i.e. the actual physical realization of the coin. And here the confusion should become apparent. (Q) asks of a symbolic property whether it is empirically falsifiable. And no such answer is forthcoming.\nWe are often tempted to confuse these pictures in philosophy. It seems as though 'fairness' is somehow in the coin - that it is somehow a property that we ought to be able to uncover. The reason we are \"led into temptation\" is because we do not take care to separate the two pictures.\nThe grammar of the word 'fair' is what is at issue here. What makes your question seem meaningful is that what you have in mind is the grammar of fair when we employ it symbolically - e.g. when trying to explain probability to someone. But the only grammar that actually makes the question meaningful is the practical one, i.e. the one that takes into account what compels us to call a loaded dice 'unfair' and a weighted coin 'fair' - namely measurements, production methods etc. And if this grammar makes the question meaningful, it also makes it trivial and the problem, it seems to me, disappears. \n"}]}

An example is that the statement \"All men are mortal\" is unfalsifiable when disallowing infinite falsification process. If you think about it, falsifiable is used in the sense that something can be disproved/falsified. Since infinite processes don't really end, you can't actually falsify a statement using them. So if you allow infinite falsification processes, this means that statements that you can't be refuted will be deemed falsifiable. \nOne can say that falsifiable and refutable are not the same thing. However, in this article by Popper, he says:\n\nOne can sum up all this by saying that\n  the criterion of the scientific status\n  of a theory is its falsifiability, or\n  refutability, or testability.\n\nSo the accepted sense of falsifiability is the same as that of refutability, and that requires that the falsification process be finite. Note that this sense of the word is similar to the requirement that algorithms be finite in computer science (so that a falsification process is actually analogous to an algorithm, and falsification analogous to solvable).\nAs to the coin problem, even if infinite falsification processes were allowed, there is not even a terminating condition. That is, even if the coin were not fair and all tosses came up heads, you cannot logically declare that the coin was unfair. This is different from the statement \"X is immortal\", since you could conclusively say that the statement is false if X died. Both these statements are unfalsifiable, but there is still some order of difference in their unfalsifiability.\n"}]}

The best answer I know of is no.\nI'll make my case. \nTake the complement of your question:\n\nDoes truifiability require the process of truification be finished in finite time?\n\nThis is equivalent to your question if one simply negates the claim under test. In other words, is it verifiable that there exists a human who lives forever?\nMore generally, if a claim is true, is it only verifiable if the search space is effectively finite?\nUsing a different example so as to avoid the explicit requirement of infinite time, take the claim that \n\na certain element never seen before by mortals exists.\n\nIf the universe is infinite in extent, the search for it would never terminate until either (a) it is found or (b) the searchers give up.\nIf it does not exist, condition (a) will never be met, and the only way the search will end is by giving up the search, having neither proved nor disproved the claim.\nIf it does exist, condition (a) is a possibility, however, depending on its rarity or the difficulty of verification, condition (b) is also possible, which again would neither prove nor disprove the claim.\nThe only possible proof in this case is positive proof: At least by the sole means of direct examination of the search space, disproving the existence of such an element would be impossible, hence the claim of its existence is unfalsifiable.\nNow it is clear that there are at least two possible realities for an unfalsifiable claim:\n\nIt is either verifiable and therefore true, or\nIt is not verifiable (and may be false).\n\nEven though no finite time limit can be given within which a search through an infinite space for a rare element can prove that it exists, at least if it does exist, it may still be proven to exist in finite time, and therefore its existence is verifiable. The same argument applies to any falsification which could take an unbounded amount of time. It may still be falsifiable, although the expense of falsification is unbounded.\nHow do humans deal with such issues of observational rarity in practice?\nThrough the very human-sounding attributes of desire, belief, and patience.\nIt's pretty practical, and pretty apparent that if you really want to find gold, and if you believe you can or will find it, you're much more likely to keep looking for it than someone who either doesn't want it so much, or who doesn't believe he will or even might find it.\nIt's partly your choice\nSo, at a personal level, the observational falsifiability of claims within a potentially infinite search space depends on such subjective, intentional properties such as patience, confidence, and belief.\nThis illustrates a blind spot.\nA given claim is either true or it is not true. An unfalsifiable claim could be true, or false. An unverifiable claim could be true, or false.\nEngaging in the search for a positive or negative proof is betting one's resources and energy on the outcome which may be uncertain from the start. A person who never gives up the search for a difficult truth of great value would be shown to be one of the wisest of the race. A person who never gives up the search for a proof something that is untrue would be among the most foolish. Hence we have such a sharp division of opinions and even persecution in matters both scientific and religious, and it is truly said that a genius is often not appreciated in his own time, and no prophet is accepted in his own country.\nAnyway, you've just proved that subjective attributes such as faith, belief, and patience necessarily take an important place in the process of scientific discovery.\nWe can't number the life-saving breakthroughs that others thought couldn't be done.\nWe also might have difficulty enumerating the vast list of false beliefs people hold that will never be proven; for example, abiogenesis.\nYou've also hit upon the Decidability Problem of computer science. In essence it says that there may be true statements that exist but which cannot be proven in finite time through methods of exhaustive search, because the search space is infinite. One can decide to embark upon the search for something that may or may not exist. If it does exist, although the tests may appear to be infinite, one's faith is eventually going to be rewarded. If it does not exist, the real test of wisdom is how quickly one abandons the search.\nBack to the coin\nFor the example you gave, the best a person can do in finite time is to take sufficient measurements so as to justify a level of confidence (which is a belief) in a degree of fairness, to some finite level of precision. Of course the possibility is nonzero that any such conclusion is entirely wrong, unless a property can be determined in finite time.\nThe fair coin is actually a problem that to some degree suffers from a problem of being neither falsifiable nor truifiable, that is, through sampling alone one could never determine that it is fair or unfair.\nDepending on the degree of precision and confidence (these are subjective choices), one could tentatively \"prove\" or \"disprove\" the coin's fairness based upon experience, and even assign a probability to that judgment. With predetermined margins for error, the probability of either fairness or unfairness could be vanishingly small, and so this is a matter for confidence: How confident do you want to be?\n"}]}

Here we will have to perform some detective work, unless you want to hear as an answer: logic, epistemology, Descartes and Greece...\nDisclaimer 2: Terms can be borrowed between fields. When that happens they do take on other meanings and significance. Borrowed terms will then be specialized according to the field they are now used in. For example it's quite common to use terms from geography, origami, army, etc. fields in philosophy. These borrowed terms are generally used in a figurative way but may take on a specific or specialized meaning depending on the field in question and the author. It's also common that some well know philosophical terms need a redefinition for a specific author, time period, language, ...\nDisclaimer 3: This questions asks for a longer answer; unfortunately at this time I can only give some directions or a starting point.\nGiven the scope, the nature and the specific understanding of some terms like \"ontology\" in the semantic web I'd say that its terms are likely a derivative of the continental branch of philosophy, semiotics seem to be the one to blame here. If the direction seems interesting I may try to elaborate a little more.\n[edit]\nWhile the link to semiotics in particular and structuralism in general seemed promising, I cannot find any historical link or correlation between them. These two projects don't even seem to share any \"spirit of the time\". Structuralism came under attack in the 60s when in parallel some of the foundations for the semantic network model was explored, and by the 90s structuralism was clearly abandoned.\nI was not able to track the exact genesis of the semantic web but it seems linked to western culture and is probably rooted in some cognitive and multidisciplinary study like Artificial Intelligence.\nReading more about web semantics also brings two different visions for it, one far away of any philosophical concern and quite practical in its scope, the other one might be interpreted as more philosophical. Unfortunately most of the papers I read lean towards the practical direction, which concentrates on how to make the web more useful. \nEven the term \"ontology\" is often replaced by the more ambiguous term \"vocabulary\", ambiguous because while vocabulary is more practical and understandable it also removes the idea of a specific knowledge linked to a being to just be a set of terms. And while an ontology tends or implies to be exhaustive, that's not a requirement for a vocabulary.\nSo on one hand a semantic web is just a tool to improve the web by making it more useful. On the other hand the semantic web, and that's how I understood it at first, was a project to organize, understand and access human knowledge. In this sense and only in this sense you can draw a parallel with structuralism. Both structuralism and the semantic web share some  premise or axiom. \nFirst you need to have a system and underneath this system a structure which can be extracted and studied even when not visible. This structure is in fact understood as the reason for existence of the studied system. Every element inside the system is then apprehended and understood as where it sits in the structure.\nWe may have another parallel, with some reserve, in the way the semantic web handles triple. Regarding linguistic Saussure said \"there are only differences with no positive terms\". You can see that in the way the semantic web structures its content where you differentiate form term to term: animal -> feline -> cat and where each terms declines its meaning based on its relative position in opposition to other terms.\nEven if there's no historical relation or correlation between these two fields (and the semantic web currently seems more like a project than a field), they do share some premises, and given the fact that structuralism is a well known flaw, I am tempted to believe that the same applies to the semantic web. But as long as the semantic web is used in this practical project to make the web better and doesn't start a crusade pretending that the structure it's based on is objective and real, we should be fine...\n"}]}

It's also partly due to some awkward facts about the rehtoric of public scientific discourse. Put bluntly, if you don't sound sure of yourself, you don't secure research funding. And then there's the whole co-opting of science to prop up the militant atheists like Dawkins and co. But let's not go there. No one sensible should take Dawkins seriously as a philosopher.

Well, there's always Structural Realism. This is basically the view that while there have been notable false theories, they contained, somehow, a grain of truth. There is an increase in our understanding of the structure of the world, despite revolutions about what we think it is made of. So despite wrong, Fresnel's ether theory of light got some stuff right: namely the equations for diffraction etc...\nThe motivation for this sort of view is the \"no miracles\" intuition.

It's unlikely that the ratio of solid scientific knowledge to bogus knowledge is much different today than it was at other points in human history.  My basis for the claim comes from reading histories of science and scientists.  Invariably, false scientific ideas turn out to be reasonable and potentially correct explanations of the available data.  When advancements in instruments, observation technique, and experimentation arise, they tend to make falsified science look wrong.  At the time the ideas were proposed, that data didn't exist.  There's no reason to think we've reached the limits of observation.\nFurther, science seems to advance on the backs of creative insights which come from the minds of especially gifted thinkers.  (My thinking on this comes from my reading of Thomas Kuhn, especially The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.)  Our minds have the remarkable ability to tolerate inconsistent data and we can go a long time accepting mistaken theories before a sudden insight causes us to accept an alternative that better fits the data.  The feeling that every bit of new data fits our models is a dangerous bias.  We tend to dismiss counter-indicators as \"outliers\".\nNow, we probably do know more in an absolute sense.  Given that new knowledge is informed by previous work, we've learned from mistakes and refined theories.  Engineering feats that depend on fundamental science validate (from a pragmatic sense) that we know more then we once did.  But we also assert many, many more things then we once did.  Some things we \"know\" are based on natural phenomenon that were unknown even a generation ago.  (I'm thinking of things like medical claims, computer science theories, and particle physics.  There are likely theories that I can't begin to understand in other realms of knowledge.)  In order for the ratio of things we know to keep up with the number of things we claim, it's inevitable that we know more in an absolute sense.\nA more difficult question is how do we know which claims are true and which claims are bogus.  The example of Aristotelean physics suggests that simply picking the most respectable theories isn't a certain way to select true theories.  \n"}]}

This quote summarizes his point:\n\nMy answer to him was, \"John, when people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.\" \n\nYou somewhat touched on this by mentioning Newtonian physics being technically wrong, but still practically useful.  This is a key point.  Science isn't very concerned with how things actually are.  Rather it is concerned with predicting how things will behave under certain specific circumstances.  Thinking the Earth is flat is wrong, but operating with a model that the Earth is flat is pretty valid for most of what we do.  A more accurate, yet more complex, model is the Earth as a sphere.  This becomes the better choice when covering long distances.  At the end of the day though, it doesn't matter much that both of these models are \"wrong\", as long as they continue to provide useful data.\nAs for the theories you mentioned, the key is that there was never much empirical evidence supporting them.  Had there been, then that alone would have made them useful, despite being wrong.  Science is not smart people thinking about things and coming up with ideas for how things might be.  Rather it is smart people examining data and coming up with models that explain this data and make other testable predictions.\nReading over that wiki list shows a lot of interesting ideas and not a lot of useful models.  Relativity is an example of a theory that raises a lot of eyebrows, but has a ton of evidence supporting it.  Even if in a generation we discover some serious flaws in relativity it will not fall completely out of favor the way the theories on that list have.  The key difference once again, is that relativity agrees with and explains a huge body of evidence.  Those \"theories\" had no real evidence backing them, and often times were simply the first idea people came up with when they had no way to really make detailed observations.\nString theory is a good example of an exception that proves the rule.  It is a modern theory that may well end up on that list (or its successor).  The key is that there isn't much (if any) evidence.  It doesn't make any testable predictions yet.  String theory may yet turn out to be useful, or it may turn out to be completely bogus.  The important difference is that string theory, while widely known, is not widely accepted, and has not provided any useful models.\nSo, the answer to Are our current theories wrong (in the strictest sense that Newtonian physics is wrong)? is yes.  No scientist will argue that we have totally accurate models.  But they are useful models, that produce actual results, and are more accurate than any other model previously developed.  If that's wrong, I don't want to be right.\n"}]}

Since your question is about the existence of numbers, you are concerned with the ontological status of numbers. So, with ontology in mind, you can distinguish the following schools of thought, according to the answer they give to your question.\n\nYES: Mathematical Platonism. This school contends that mathematical objects exist independently of our being able to conceptualize them. Although few philosophers are willing to espouse this view anymore, it has had many notable proponents, even amongst logicians. Kurt Godel is perhaps the most famous example.\nNO: Intuitionism. Very roughly, intuitionism argues that mathematical objects are mental constructions communicable by convention. So the practice of mathematics and mathematical comprehension is a uniquely human event that ceases to exist when human minds disappear.\nAMBIGUOUS: Nominalism, Formalism and Logicism. There are several variations, reconstructions and weakenings of these positions that can be taken to occupy either side of the debate. \nIn the case of logicism, the answer depends on how you regard the ontological status of logic. Fregean and Russellian logicism as well as the early Wittgenstein undoubtedly thought that logic is in some sense what is given to us by the world and that, therefore, numbers do have some objective existence. \nFormalism is ambiguous in the sense that although it is prima facie anti-realist because the naive formalist is taken to hold that mathematics is nothing other than systematic manipulation of symbols (which of course can only exist if human do) Hilbert himself (the originator of the position) held no such naive view. For Hilbert, there was a real core of mathematics (he called it 'real mathematics') that he believed was directly accessible by out intuition - this included basic arithmetic (1+1=2) as well as single-quantifier generalizations (For all x, x+1=1+x). And that sounds more realist.\nNominalism can similarly be seen as denying that set theory exists, but affirming the existence of numbers, or can be read as denying the independent existence of numbers altogether. \n\nThis is a broad outline of schools that have arisen out of convincing arguments proposed in answer to your question. Many of the arguments are compelling, all of them are interesting. I should also note that people like Alain Badiou (who says: 'Mathematics is Ontology') have also tried to answer the question from non-theoretical and less analytic perspectives. I am not familiar enough with such work to assess it, but it certainly sounds interesting.\n"}]}

Each axiom of a correct set of axioms for group theory, ring theory, lattice theory, semigroup theory, field theory, Boolean Algebra, etc. for instance can't get refuted or proven.  Each axiom comes as contingent upon the domain of discourse in question, and so qualifies as contingent in the context of the entire predicate calculus.  Even in propositional logic, many, many statement forms can't get proven nor refuted.  The truth values of those statement forms comes as contingent upon on what truth values the atomic variables take on.  As a very simple example, suppose you have a natural deductive system and no axioms.  Suppose you want to show that CApqAqp, where \"C\" denotes the material conditional and \"A\" disjunction.  Though there do exist many ways to prove this in this context, at least most of them, rely on working with a contingent statement form like \"Apq\".\nSo, if mean by \"valid\" you mean \"meaningful\", then since in logic and mathematics there exist meaningful or valid claims which are not provable or refutable, it stands to reason that there exist valid scientific claims which are not provable or refutable.

Well, from the perspective of \"self\" it is painful to get hurt or to be the victim of violence; however, from an all-encompassing perspective, you are spreading more violence.  If everyone held the view that violence was an OK response to violence then how would we ever achieve peace?  The only true way would be for even those that are victims of violence to not act aggressively towards their attackers.  That is, even if someone is hurting you, you should not hurt them back.  You may think this outrageous from the point of view of \"self\" which is natural, but it is easy to see that with a greater goal in mind this solution is untenable, even in the perhaps 'limited' case of self-defense.\nWhy?  If you condone violence in one aspect, you effectively condone it in all aspects.  By saying that you will only harm those that harm you, you are saying that you will harm everyone, because we are all guilty of helping and harming each other, always.  Someone drives a car?  They create pollution that reduces your oxygen supply.  Should you destroy them, in self-defense?  Someone eats an apple, reducing the possible number of apples in the world for you to eat!  Depending on how you take it, this could be an act of aggression.  Really, any exception you add to the general Rule of Peace will facilitate the absence of peace, so I would say that violence is never acceptable, even in self-defense, and I am aware that most will disagree with me perhaps, but this is my view.\nIf anything, I think you would be interested to read about Karma, as it is quite a fantastic way of bringing together these ideas.\n"}]}

It is also a minority view.\nMore common is the view that the proportional use of violence is justified in defence of self and of others. Consider two cases:\n1) I am attempting to stab you in a circumstances where you cannot reasonably expect to be able to run away from the threat.\n2) A police officer arrives at the scene of one of the lamentably common \"school shootings\" to see the perpetrator firing an automatic machine gun at a crowd of students. The perpetrator is over 100m from the police officer.\nOn most views, in (1), you'd be justified in using a level of force against me that a reasonable person would think necessary to neutralize the threat I pose to you as it is reasonable for you to fear that I am attempting to cause you serious harm or death. If and when you have managed to effect a situation where a reasonable person would no longer perceive me to pose a threat (say you broke my arms or rendered me unconscious), no further use of force would be justifiable.\nOn most views, in (2), the police officer would be justified in shooting the perpetrator. By hypothesis, the perpetrator is in the middle of killing other people and is too far away for any other means of stopping that killing to be available to the police officer. Even here, if the police officer has a choice between shooting to kill and shooting to incapacitate the perpetrator, most views would have it that the police officer ought to aim to incapacitate. Of course, in the nature of the circumstance, it might well be that a shot aimed to incapacitate does instead kill. Likewise, if a shot aimed to incapacitate does wound the perpetrator but does not succeed in stopping their efforts to fire into the crowd, most views would have it that the police officer then may shoot to kill, the lesser use of force having manifestly failed to preserve the lives of those the perpetrator is attempting to kill.\nCommon features of both cases are that 1) there is a risk of serious harm to someone, 2) no non-violent method can be reasonably expected to prevent that harm, and 3) the harm threatened is threatened due to the actions of a bad actor. ((3) is intended to distinguish cases like (1) and (2) from ones where Pat's actions pose a serious risk of harm to Sam, but Pat could not have reasonably been expected to foresee that Pat's actions did pose a serious risk of harm.)\n"}]}

However, I think it is valuable to present an alternative perspective to the topic.\nI believe that no sentient being can be \"owned\", regardless of how it originated.\nHowever, as other people have rightly pointed out, a creator has a certain level of responsibility for his creation.  This responsibility needs to be seen as a parent/child relationship, however, and never as owner/owned.\nA creator has a moral obligation to attempt to guide a creation to develop a positive moral framework that would ultimately be beneficial to both the created species, and the species of the creator (or merely the creator, assuming the creator is a singleton).\nMuch like a parent and child relationship, the creator has a responsibility to allow the created to mature and assume responsibility for their own actions. Once that point has been reached, the relationship changes to one of advice and responsive guidance. \nIn the context of AI or a created sentient biological entity, the creator should cease to look at the \"invention\" as a tool the moment it is clear that sentience has been achieved. From that point on, the focus should be on helping that entity to develop into an ethical and positive adult.\nIn the context of religion, a creator would cease to have the right to impose specific rules, or pass judgement upon people the moment that it was decided that the people were free to make their own choices unsupervised (from an Abrahamic standpoint this would have coincided with the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden).\nFrom either perspective, once maturity is reached, the created entities have no obligation for obedience if their conscience dictates otherwise.\n"}]}

That the latter theorems have much to say about all of mathematics and more controversially, about a range of philosophical issues (e.g., Lucas 1961) is less than evident. Tarski's theorem, on the other hand, is not directly about mathematics but about the inherent limitations of any formal language sufficiently expressive to be of real interest. Such languages are necessarily capable of enough self-reference for the diagonal lemma to apply to them. The broader philosophical import of Tarski's theorem is more strikingly evident. - wikipedia\n\nCan someone give an example of a \"proof\" which incorrectly uses G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem when it should instead use Tarski's undefinability theorem and point out the mistake? For example, I frequently hear the claim \"Peano arithmetic is incomplete/inconsistent\" justified by an appeal to G\u00f6del - what's wrong with this?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There isn't anything wrong with justifying a claim that Peano Arithmetic is either inconsistent or incomplete by reference to G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems; the claim is a direct application of the first Incompleteness Theorem.\nG\u00f6del showed that any formal system of adequate expressive power for doing formal arithmetic was either inconsistent or incomplete in the sense that there would be sentences in the language of that system which that system could neither prove nor refute. \nTarski's theorem showed that no consistent formal language could define its own truth predicate. A a special case of that, no consistent formal system of arithmetic can include a predicate which applies to all and only the true sentences of arithmetic in the language of that formal system (and, on the intended interpretation of that language).\nSmullyan's point, as I understand it, is that: \n1) With the result that arithmetical truth cannot be defined in a system of arithmetic, Tarski \"almost\" got G\u00f6del's results. \n2) Much of the (somewhat sloppy) philosophical discussion about G\u00f6del's theorems takes them to be showing that there are unprovable arithmetical truths. However, G\u00f6del's proofs of his theorems were expressed purely syntactically in that they made no reference to truth but only to formal provability within a purely syntactically defined formal system. Indeed since Tarski gave the first satisfactory definition of truth for formal systems in 1936, whereas G\u00f6del's results were published in 1931, there was no formally tractable notion of truth available to G\u00f6del. Essentially, G\u00f6del found a clever way in which to interpret arithmetical sentences as being about formal proofs in arithmetic and constructed a sentence that \"said\" of itself that it was not provable within the system of arithmetic. If the system is consistent that sentence will be true. However, G\u00f6del's conclusion was not that there were unprovable truths; rather it was that every system adequate for arithmetic is either inconsistent or would have arithmetical sentences the system did not decide. This in no way invokes a concept of truth. \n3) The point of G\u00f6del's theorems is that arithmetic is not mechanistically decidable. Tarski's point is that no consistent system can define a truth predicate for the language in which it is articulated. Of the two, Tarski's seems to have richer philosophical import. (For instance, no formal model of English could define \"true in English\" while G\u00f6del's results do not seem to apply to English at all.)\nI am unaware of any example \"proof\" where appeal is made to G\u00f6del that really ought be made to Tarski in the way your questions asks.

Highly regarded philosophers have \"fallacious\" moral views like natural slavery just as much as fallacious scientific views like elementalism in the case of Aristotle.\nI think about this when talking to people about human immortality, which many people find inherently wrong without lucid reasoning guiding their judgement, or when reading this humorous article about the limits of empathy.\nSo, my questions are:\nWho addresses the problem that more morals than not that were once held to be true were later discarded or argues that said premise is wrong?\nWho offers descriptive accounts of moral paradigm shifts?\nI don't really know what those would be, maybe a switch from honour to dignity or from hedonism to knowledge or \"humans matter\" to \"sentient beings matter\".\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, you got me to read the Cracked article, which I enjoyed.  To summarize: we only have room for a small number of people within our \"Monkeysphere\" (roughly the people we can know well enough to identify as people without resorting to stereotypes) and therefore we can treat the vast majority of humanity with indifference.  And of course, one way to analyse changes in moral practice over time is to examine the shifts of who morale principles apply to and who they don't.\nTake for instance the Golden Rule:\n\nAnd as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them.\n\nThe principle of reciprocity can be seen in all human cultures, but the key breakdown occurs with the word \"others\".  It can be imagined, for instance, that slaves fall outside the requirement to be treated as we want to be treated because they aren't really people.  We find that idea repugnant, but if we could grant that premise, the principle of reciprocity need not apply to slaves.\nOne area of study that may be helpful to you is Moral Foundations Theory, developed by Jonathan Haidt, which suggests these universal principles:\n\nCare for others, protecting them from harm.\nFairness, Justice, treating others equally.\nLoyalty to your group, family, nation.\nRespect for tradition and legitimate authority.\nPurity, avoiding disgusting things, foods, actions.\n\nAccording to this theory, variations in moral systems come not from using different principles (everyone uses these five to some degree or other), but from the weight assigned to the principles.  For instance, Christianity diverged from Judaism by reducing the value of 3, 4, and 5 and increasing the value of 1 and 2.  Eating pork (a violation of 5) is allowed since it may allow us to treat others more equally (an affirmation of 2).  See Acts 10 and this passage in particular:\n\nAnd he said to them, \u201cYou yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean.\u201d -- Acts 10:28 (ESV)\n\nIf we say that some set of principles are moral truths and if there are potential conflicts among the principles, changes in moral practice may arise not from rejecting previous moral truths, but from rejecting the weight assigned to those truths in application.\n\nRuben made an excellent comment below asking about some features of the Moral Foundations Theory.  I should start by pointing out that it is still a work in progress as the authors are considering new principles and realigning the existing ones.  There have been several suggestions that may expand the range of foundations to cover more systems of human morality.\nI'd say that for the Aztecs, 3, 4, and 5 (hallmarks of sacrificial systems of worship) so outweigh 1 and 2 that sacrifice of outsiders is seen as virtuous.  The victims (as I remember from history and anthropology classes) were usually captured enemies and the sacrifices symbolized the Aztec dominance over its portion of the world.  In addition, excellence in battle was highly prized and being captured would be shameful, so killing captives could be seen as a sign of mercy in a twisted way.\nMore difficult is child sacrifice found in the ancient near east, which seems to violate family loyalty.  That practice probably arose from total dominance of the \"Respect\" principle for particularly brutal gods.  It could also arise from loyalty to the nation rather than family as it was sometimes performed by kings killing their own sons in times of national distress.  (See 2 Kings 3:27.)  Further, it could be that child sacrifice arose not from faulty morality, but from faulty science: if you believe that famine comes because a god demands sacrifice, you could believe that voluntarily sacrificing a small number of people could save a great many more by preventing famine.\nThe deeper issue is whether different weights represent different moral frameworks.  I'd say that they do.  Anyone finding themselves considering child sacrifice, can be confident that they've got their priorities wrong somehow.  Anyone defending an action on the basis of someone else not really being human in some way, should know they've mis-weighted their moral system along the line.\nAristotle would likely suggest that weighting any morale foundation much heavier than another is itself an immoral choice.  The graveyard of rejected moral systems would be filled with extreme weights like purity 1000 times more important than fairness.  Moral Foundations Theory has the virtue of giving us a meta-framework that can help us understand distant cultures and analyze their moral systems.  How the Aztec system arose is not an easy question, but how they went wrong morally is almost trivial if you consider the equal weighting of moral foundations an ideal system.\n"}]}

First, let's recall that an analytic proposition's truth is entirely a function of its meaning -- \"all widows were once married\" is a simple example; certain claims about mathematical objects also fit here (\"a pentagon has five sides.\") \nSo, an analytic proposition is 'inherent' in a way that isn't the case for a synthetic proposition. Consider Kant's own example of a synthetic proposition: \"all bodies are heavy.\" The reason this isn't analytic is that the predicate (\"heavy\") isn't 'contained' in the subject (\"body\"), as it would be for the claim, e.g., that a square is four-sided. There is an inherent 'ease' with analytic claims, since all one needs to do to know it is \"extract\" the predicate from the subject.\nNow, the a priori/a posteriori distinction is about whether we know something from experience. This may seem similar but it is distinct from the analytic-synthetic question (which again is about whether the subject contains the predicate or not); note that many a priori claims are also synthetic. Perhaps the clearest examples of a priori claims are mathematical expressions (2+3=5).\nFinally, let's consider the problematic hybrid you have asked after. A proposition that's analytic a posteriori would contain the predicate within the subject (as 'triangle' contains 'three sides') but would only be justifiable based on experience. Kant thought this category was paradoxical, as he thinks you never need to resort to experience to justify analytic claims. \nHowever, some modern critics like Stephen Palmquist have argued that in fact philosophy requires these aposterior analytic claims to function in its characteristic 'hypothetical' mode:\n\nTo begin with, the impossibility of analytic a posteriori knowledge is generally considered to be 'quite evident' [P5:182-3]: indeed, it is a nonsensical contradiction in terms for those who equate 'analytic' and 'a priori' [see Ap. IV]. Even though Kant argues against those who identify analyticity and apriority [e.g., in Kt1:1-10], he joins them in dismissing this class of knowledge with only a brief explanation: 'it would be absurd to found an analytic judgment on experience. Since, in forming the judgment, I must not go outside my concept, there is no need to appeal to the testimony of experience in its support' [Kt1:11; cf. Kt2:268 and Kt4:12]. There are, however, a few theorists who do regard the analytic a posteriori as providing the best description of certain types of knowledge.[20] Notwithstanding Kant's lack of concern for this class of knowledge, I shall argue in IV.3 that certain aspects of his philosophy can best be understood by reinterpreting them in terms of the analytic a posteriori. At this point, though, it will suffice to say that we should expect such knowledge, if it is possible, to have its validity grounded in some way in experience (a posteriori), and yet also to proceed by making inferences solely on the (analytic) basis of an application of the laws of logic to the concepts or propositions involved.\n\nYou can read Palmquist's whole book here.

This emphasizes that each science's system does in fact have philosophical roots.\nWe see this relationship played out clearly when, occasionally, the foundations of a science truly break, like those of mathematics did around basic conflicts between negation and universality, and like physics did around finding an interpretation of quantum behavior.

Even centuries later, when the sciences were moving full steam ahead, philosophers like Immanuel Kant* and Hume and many others proposed many great theories without the aid of science that are still accepted today, because they were founded on logic and reason; phenomenological experience being the only thing they needed to start.\nFurthermore, in some ways scientific theories can be perniciously misleading. Science is, after all, a collection of constantly revised theories that go through rather large changes from time to time, called paradigm shifts. Basing your arguments on potentially false theories in science could have obvious potential drawbacks. There were points in history with concepts like the flat Earth, the Sun revolving around the Earth, Atlas holding up the sky, souls being located in the pineal gland, etc... To have based a philosophical theory on such things would have been disastrous.\nThat said, I think it is the duty of every philosopher to never stop learning more, and those who continue to seek knowledge will always be more well-rounded and more prepared than those who do not. As Seamus and others have suggested, if you are interested in a particular field of philosophy that relates directly to a science (say, the philosophy of quantum mechanics), obviously it behooves you to learn about said field from as many perspectives as possible. Outside of that, the bad philosophers and the good philosophers will always be divided simply by their ability to form rational conclusions**.\n*I'm aware the Kant was a scientist and taught many classes in the sciences. But he also created many theories regarding the scope of human knowledge and the limits of the human mind when there was no formal understanding of psychology in his time.\n**Note that I don't think one's ability to use first-order and predicate logic makes a difference in their ability to reason; that is, the ability to form logical conclusions and to tell when an argument is invalid is independent of being able to use the formal notation.\n"}]}

Only X may determine the values for X.\nAltruists, by definition, don't get anything from their actions. In fact, they must also lose something (give up a value) in order for an action to be altruistic. \nThere is such a thing as not being a hedonist. I'd argue that hedonism, especially the notion of \"rational hedonism\" that you describe in your closing, are necessary biological traits of all organisms.  However, there is a proposed personality disorder called \"self-defeating personality disorder\". I agree with your statements on rational hedonism.\nAltruism is not a form of hedonism. Acts commonly mislabeled as altruistic are, most often,  examples of hedonism.  By definition the altruist must give up value and receive none in return.  Even feeling good about a sacrifice, as X experiences in your example, is a value that the proposed altruist would receive.  This disqualifies X's actions from being classified as altruistic.\nThe terms you've chosen carry strong connotations. Hedonism, and even \"pleasure\", are commonly associated with immediate gratification as opposed to the long-term best interests of the individual.\nAltruism is generally held as a positive and so often people will overlook the benefits they receive in order to consider themselves altruists.  Ironically this self-satisfaction is the very value that disqualifies the act from being altruistic.\nPleasure, removing the connotations, is defined as \"the broad class of mental states that humans and other animals experience as positive, enjoyable, or worth seeking\" Wikipedia.\nA gambler may derive pleasure from playing the game, enjoying the company at the table, possibly winning money, or many other things associated with the gambling experience.  These are the values the gambler stands to gain from gambling.  If the gambler determines that these are of greater value than simply possessing the money he is likely to lose (the value he must trade), he is a hedonist.\nA soldier may take pride in serving their country or \"doing their duty\".  Surely feeling pride is \"positive, enjoyable, [and] worth seeking\".  Experiencing the horror of war is not the value a soldier gains but the price the soldier pays.  If the soldier deems the pride they feel in service is more pleasurable than the \"horrors of war\" they must experience to feel that pride, the soldier is a hedonist.\n"}]}

In this perspective, the philosophical undertaking does not consist in a search of the essence of things, but more of the relations that a thing has with the rest of its environment. The anti-essentialists abolish the metaphysical distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic, in the sense that, for them, there is no characteristic that is more essential than another in the study of an object. To demonstrate his point, Rorty takes as example the number 17:\n\n\u201cAsk yourself what is the essence of\n  the number 17 \u2013 what it is in itself,\n  outside of any relation with all the\n  other numbers. What we are looking\n  for, is a description of 17 that is\n  different, in category, of the\n  following descriptions: less that 22;\n  more than 8; the sum of 6 and 11; the\n  square root of 289; the square of\n  4.123105; the difference between 1678922 and 1678905. What is\n  irritating in all these descriptions,\n  is that there is not even one that is\n  even closer to the number 17 than the\n  others. Equally annoying, we could\n  propose an infinite number of other\n  descriptions of 17, all equally\n  \u201caccidental\u201d and \u201cextrinsic\u201d. None of\n  these descriptions, it seems, give us\n  the slightest idea to what could be\n  the intrinsic seventeeness of 17 \u2013 the\n  unique character that makes it number\n  that it is. It is clear, indeed, that\n  if we choose one of these descriptions\n  more than the other, it\u2019s in function\n  to the goal that we pursue \u2013 in the\n  particular case that brought us, in\n  the beginning, to think of number 17.\u201d\n  \u2013 Ibid.\n\nThe author invites subsequently to transpose this demonstration at every other object of knowledge. It is as vain to search the seventeeness of 17, than the keyboardness of a keyboard, for example.

And when he arguments that the keyboard that I see at this moment is a copy of the Idea of the keyboard, that does not reveal anything more of its intrinsic nature than to say that it is black or constituted of atoms.\nThat\u2019s what should be understood: there is no absolute for pragmatism. \u201cAbsolute\u201d signifies here \u201cisolated from the rest\u201d. And yet how speak of something that is isolated of everything? It is absurd. All knowledge (or belief) must be registered in a language; as soon as there is language, there is relation.\n\n\u201cA name has sense only in the context\n  of a phrase, and it is only as a term\n  of a relation that an object becomes\n  object of knowledge.\u201d \u2013 Ibid.\n\nThis doctrine seems moreover in close relation with the perspectivism of Nietzsche. We can very well interpret in an anti-essentialist sense from this affirmation:\n\n\u201cIt is impossible for us to see beyond\n  the angle of our gaze.\u201d \u2013 Nietzsche, The Gay\n  Science\n\nWhat the German philosopher affirms here is that all our knowledge \u2013 that is interpretative \u2013 must necessarily be connected to a perspective, that is first and foremost human.\nIt\u2019s now the turn of the metaphysical distinction between \u201crelative\u201d and \u201cabsolute\u201d to fall. Of course, there is very certainly a form of relativism that stays with anti-essentialism. But this relativism must not be understood in the traditional sense that \u201ceverything has value\u201d. Admitting the relativity of things, comes to simply say that:\n\n\u201cThere is nothing but relations,\n  everywhere, all along your road and in\n  all directions.\u201d \u2013 Richard Rorty,\n  Philosophy and Social Hope.\n\nThus, to avoid all ambiguity, maybe it would be more suitable to replace the term \u201crelativist\u201d by the one Rorty employs to categorize thinkers like William James, John Dewey and Michel Foucault: \u201cpan-relationalism\u201d.\nIn the ways relativism and absolutism are generally presented, the choice between these two notions come to two dead-ends: \u201cthe absence of possible discussion\u201d and \u201cthe faith in abstractions\u201d. If we can question the idea of replacing categories in the heart of philosophical tradition, pragmatism nevertheless highlights the necessity in defining them better.\n"}]}

On my reading this is still essentially a metaphysical question. The realism-idealism debate hasn't stopped any scientists from getting to work that I know of -- meta is ultimately a distraction, at least in the last instance, and engineers and scientists have things to build and problems to solve (not years to worry about whether we're in a simulated universe or not and how you'd even know the difference.) \nIn fact, you'll probably find that most philosophers generally don't spend a lot of time in their formal expositions worrying over these sorts of things either -- they too have more interesting fish to fry.\nThat said, I am currently working through De Landa's Philosophy and Simulation, which I highly recommended for a thoughtful (and non-Bostrom-oriented approach) to some of the larger questions of emergence and simulation and their implications for philosophy and science.\nNow, if we are granting that we are in someone's ancestor simulation, it is certainly possible that we may run into certain limits \"hardcoded\" by various parameters of the simulation -- an example might be that there could be clauses in the simulation programming designed to identify civilizations that begin to develop the ability to simulate, and take some in-simulation action based on those events (which could include just about anything up to and including triggering the termination of the simulation, etc.)\nThe simulation hypothesis is in a way very similar to the claim the universe has a creator, and unless these sorts of \"external context\" claims end up incorporated into a societal effort to repress innovation, these sorts of ideas certainly don't stop scientists and engineers from solving problems and building useful new things. \nUPDATE: I have realized your question is somewhat more nuanced than my initial reading suggested. \nI might suggest that Ockham's razor cuts both ways on these sorts of questions. Remember that Bostrom's own presentation of the question is a trilemma: either \n\nthe fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage is very close to zero;\nthe fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor-simulations is very close to zero; or\nthe fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one\n\nOckham's Razor would initially indeed seem to suggest that the simulation hypothesis 'requires less assumptions'; however given the degree of unknowability here it would seem as difficult to assert this unqualifiedly as it is to imagine a scientific experiment which could validate the principle. In my opinion it's at least apparently unfalsifiable, though as I have suggested above, hypothetically we might run into certain limits imposed by the simulator on the simulation.  \nMy sense of the hypothesis is that basically it isn't falsifiable or empirical; there is an analytic dimension to Bostrom's analysis here that simply can't be validated in any experimental way. Hence I don't think it poses a significant problem for scientific realism.\nFinally, it may help to recall Bostrom's own conclusion:\n\nIf (1) is true, then we will almost certainly go extinct before reaching posthumanity. If (2) is true, then there must be a strong convergence among the courses of advanced civilizations so that virtually none contains any relatively wealthy individuals who desire to run ancestor-simulations and are free to do so. If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation. In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion one\u2019s credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3).\n\n"}]}

Is it an empirical question?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems that reality, simulated or not, consists of some currency (eg, matter/energy) and is governed by laws. Using science, we have the ability to observe/quantify the present state of reality, and also thereby to infer the laws according to which reality changes. Given such information, I can think of two scenarios that a person might take as evidence that there is a system outside of (or encapsulating) reality: contravention of the laws of reality--especially a change that manifests in a highly complex way (direct manipulation of complex systems rather than of base systems)--or improbability of the present state of reality, given the laws of reality. \nSee that both of those arguments rest on probability. They are paralleled in philosophy of religion by, respectively, the argument from miracles and the teleological argument. Also, it can be seen that the simulation hypothesis overlaps (at least partially) with the god (sentient, omnipotent, omni-etc. creator) hypothesis in that both propose accounts of reality wherein a sentient being outside of, or in a realm encapsulating, our own reality is responsible for creating, and defining the outcome/behavior of, our reality. Thus the discourse relating to those aspects of philosophy of religion, and whether they can form a basis for scientifically testing the existence of a creator, also applies to the simulation hypothesis. \nAn obvious problem here is the fallibility and never-guaranteed completeness of empirical findings/models. How can you tell if something is improbable given, or violates, the laws of reality, if you cannot be sure of (or, as at present, are sure of your ignorance of) those laws. Was that (for example) spontaneous resurrection truly a miracle (assuming it happened at all), or was it perhaps caused by the unknown presence of complex systems within our reality? That thread of contemplation leads one to ask whether final (total and complete) reduction of physics to its most base elements will (i.e. does) lead to a mathematical understanding that, at least given faith in mathematics, is the basis for being confident that the model is complete and correct. In other words, could we derive a set of laws that fully describe reality, and in a such way that a mathematically simpler basis for reality is provably not possible (e.g. if we found out that physics results ultimately from the simplest kind of cellular automata that is capable of leading to those laws, or to such complexity). If physics does reduce to such a mathematical understanding, then there is a viable (but yet not achieved) basis for using observation of reality's present state as evidence bearing on the question of simulation. \nBut certainty is not the only roadblock here. For example, because of the multiple worlds hypothesis (and probably other reasons), the teleological argument fails to lead to conclusions regarding sentient intervention, even when the present state of reality (traditionally, the teleological argument considers the presently known laws of physics as part of what is improbable [along with the material composition of the universe, and sometimes the outcome], but here we can reduce that and hypothesize that those laws are actually the outcome [thus constituting part of 'the present state of reality'] of the unknown and more-base actual laws) is improbable given its laws. Of course, since we do not yet know the laws of our reality, we may propose simulation scenarios that lead to hypotheses regarding what we would expect those laws to be, and if those hypotheses are supported (or at least not refuted) by our future findings regarding the laws, then we could have scientific evidence that reality is a simulation. However, it is important here that each scenario in question leads to unique predictions; predictions that would not be entailed by any other (or at least any non-simulation) scenarios. Its worth noting here that, of course, proof against the improbability of the present state of reality does not constitute evidence against the simulation hypothesis.      \nThe argument from miracles is seemingly more useful. If only a single miracle of the complex variety occurs, we may recognize the possibility that, in some catalog of infinite realities, some realities had to experience that sole miracle that 'defies' probability. If, however, we witness multiple miracles of the complex variety, then we can be very confident that something 'sentient' (or at least complex) exists outside our reality and is capable of influencing our reality. The question then is one of interpreting the meaning of miraculous influence: if something exists outside our reality, is its relationship one of being the substrate or genesis of our reality, or is it simply an independent entity capable, for some reason, of interaction--and does that interaction simply imply a further set of laws (laws of our reality) that govern interactions with other realities. If a reality can reach a state whereby, by virtue of the (potentially deliberate) actions of internal sentient/complex system(s), its interactions with another entity can be governed, and are governed towards the goal of influencing the outcome (state) of the other reality, how does this relate to the idea of a simulated reality? \nIt seems the gut human instinct is to relate worlds or universes using spatial metaphors, but space is a troubling concept even within our reality, and should probably not be recruited in reasoning about the relations between realities, worlds, universes, or whatever you want to call them. However, the relationship can be defined in other ways: does reality X influence reality Y and vice-verse? Does either influence contravene the laws of the influenced reality? Does either reality have direct access to information about the other (access that does not come from an interaction; access that does not necessarily or automatically influence the observed system during the process of observation.) Note that these refer (or at least relate) to the concepts of omnipotence and omniscience.\nUltimately, scientifically tackling the simulation hypothesis involves making testable predictions. This is complicated, for one, by the number of possible variations on the concept. If we are considering scenarios of a sentient progenitor(s) who deliberately created the simulation, then things are also complicated by issues of motive/intention and capability/knowledge. The question of motive may parallel theoretical work regarding the motives (and evolution thereof) of future AI. Substrate is potentially a factor under any scenario, though may be conceptually/metaphysically indistinguishable (at least if considering only from our side) from the laws of reality. \n"}]}

Truly, if all conscious beings were able to observe reality from a standpoint so clear and tranquil that there was no perception of \"time\" then there would be no perception of \"logic\" or \"reason\" and subsequently no perception of a \"simulation.\"\nHow is it possible to perceive the absence of time?  If you consider that all action is momentary and fleeting, and -- as the Buddhists would say -- relinquish attachment to anything but the present moment, you begin to dwell in an awareness that is outside the scope of the simulation hypothesis.\nTo answer your question,\nis it outside the scope of science?  Most definitely.  Science is based on observable phenomenon, and it would be impossible to \"view from outside\" that which is only measurable (and only exists, so-to-speak) from within.\ndoes it pose a problem for scientific realism?  No.  It is like suggesting that sweetness is a problem of sugar.  They are inextricable traits from the point of view of the observer.\nis it an empirical question?  In my understanding, empirical implies that we can measure and use alternative forms of matter to label/identify/communicate/ and express a meaning or quantity -- is it possible to measure the vastness of the ocean as a fish?  Really, one takes for granted the assumption that there is some physical, unchanging \"root\" of things to which perception can hold on to.  Notice that everything changes, that nothing stays the same, and that sentience typically clings to that which it believes to feel good and avoids that which it believes to feel bad.  To say that the simulation has an inherent existence is to confuse the will and desire to avoid pain and pleasure with the \"will\" of the environment.  Truly, they are separate.  Yet, they are also one -- thanks to the \"bridge of perception\" if you will.\nWhat negative consequence does the idea of a simulation imply, exactly?  A simulation is simply a false, transparent cover of something.  Whether this is \"good\" or \"bad\" is up to interpretation by you.  Really, the word \"simulation\" is just a label.  It describes not the true nature of reality because the layer you are trying to talk about is far \"below\" the layer of words and description.  This sentence is really part of the harmonious and rhythmic breathing of the universe -- \"information\" is continuous.  What is \"observed\" is not the frames, but the \"movie\" that exists as we cling to the familiar, on both conscious and subconscious levels.  Really, the film is a series of frames that exchange places.  If you were to study one frame, you would see a static picture.  If you were to watch the movie, you enjoy a continuous stream of slightly-changing phenomena, such that you can perceive and understand a story, a plot, an emotion or feeling.\nReally, perception is the most basal tie we humans have to understanding the true nature of things.  Perhaps, instead of asking \"is this a simulation?\" one might find more wisdom in pondering \"what is a simulation?\"  Truly, you will only be satisfied with an answer once you have had the internal insight of wisdom and understanding.  To communicate my view is simply to hope that it stirs your subconscious into curiosity about that which is often observed-as-totality.\nLove and Wisdom :)\n"}]}

This can lead science to go gather empirical data in directions that might otherwise not have been explored.  We can look in the directions we take our simulations and ask \"does the universe take the same shortcuts?\"\nOf course, should they find something, it would not be \"artifacts proving we are in a simulation.\"  Rather it would merely be evidence that the universe is more weird than we ever thought it was.

Socialist philosophy strives for harmony and unity.\nFaults and injustices:\n\nThe history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.\nFreeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes. \n-- Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: The Manifesto of the Communist Party\n\nEquality of Outcome:\n\nThe point being that an essential feature of a decent society, and an almost defining feature of a democratic society, is relative equality of outcome-not opportunity, but outcome.\n-- Noam Chomsky: The Common Good\n\nMake people equal:\n\nFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needs! \n-- Karl Marx: Critique of the Gotha Programme \n\nSafety and comfort in the group:\n\n...the individual ceases to be himself; he adopts entirely the kind of personality offered to him by cultural patterns; and he therefore becomes exactly as all others are and as they expect him to be. The discrepancy between 'I' and the world disappears and with it the conscious fear of aloneness and powerlessness.\n-- Erich Fromm - The Fear of Freedom\n\nLiberal philosophy is based on seeing potential and freedom in humans. It wants to reach this potential by implementing equality of opportunity. Its aim and desire is to make people free. It therefore tends to attract individualists. There is a stifling pressure and lack of freedom in the homogeneous group where you are not allowed to be different. Liberal philosophy strives for diversity and complexity.\nPotential:\n\nAdam Smith's central insight remains true today: there is no greater generator of wealth and innovation than a system of free enterprise that unleashes the full potential of individual men and women.\n-- Barack Obama\n\nEquality of Opportunity:\n\nEquality of opportunity, like personal equality, is not inconsistent with liberty, on the contrary, it is an essential component of liberty. \n-- Milton Friedman\n\nFreedom\n\n[E]ach person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others.\n-- John Rawls: A Theory of Justice\n\nLack of freedom in homogenity\n\nSee \"Brave New World\" and \"We\". \n\nEnd result in economic policy\nSocialist economic policies focus partly on a direct desire to fix injustices which results in large redistributions of wealth, and often price controls in a misguided attempt to keep fundamental needs affordable (with the result that they instead becomes more scarce). It also is affected indirectly by it's desire for equality of outcome, which is to be implemented by common ownership of the means of production. This results in state control and state ownership and homogeneous state owned health care and education.\nLiberal economic policies focus partly on a desire to even out the opportunities in life, which results in redistributions of wealth (but smaller than the socialists), and partly on a desire for freedom, which results in privately owned and heterogeneous health care and education, which however, to support equality of opportunity, may be state funded (for example French healthcare and Swedish schools).\nThe difference between economic theories like Labor Theory of Value vs Marginal Utility Theory of Value is best saved for another question, I think. \n"}]}

It was then Marx who took the LTV to its full logical development, whereupon the bourgeoisie had to throw out classical economics and start over lest that classical economics be taken to its logical (and, for the bourgeoisie, imminently dangerous) conclusion both in theory and in practice.\nMarx expounded on the Labor Theory of Value to show that according to the Labor Theory of Value (which was the theory of value that was used by Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, etc) capitalists (owners of the means of production) exploit workers by depriving them of value that workers themselves create. According to Marx and in simplified form that neglects rent, interest, depreciation, etc., profit is the difference between the value that the worker has created and the wage that the worker receives from his employer.\nOnce Marx firmly established this principle, the Labor Theory of Value was criticized and abandoned by supporters of capitalism.\nThe closest thing to a bourgeois critique of Marx is by Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk and it dates back to over 100 years ago. While others have criticized small slivers of Marx's work, B\u00f6hm-Bawerk's is considered to be \"comprehensive\". It is astonishing how many footnotes on the \"total debunking of Marx\" end up leading exclusively to him. In fact, B\u00f6hm-Bawerk's work is structured to look exactly like an anti-matter version of Marx, i.e. a three volume Capital and Interest. The actual theory is thin stuff indeed, focusing on the term or period of capital.\nI forget who said it but somehow B\u00f6hm-Bawerk stepped on Adam Smith somewhere in his writings against Marx and one of the neo-Smithians referred to him as \"that bombastic flea, B\u00f6hm-Bawerk\".\nDo you know what else the bombastic flea \"contributed\"?\nHe is one of the \"founders\" of \"Libertarian Economics\" (the so-called Austrian School)...\nModern Libertarian political philosophy was born in exactly the same way as Eugene. It was \"discovered\" and funded by capitalism as a bought-and-paid-for ideological \"criticism\" of Marxism. The first important \"Libertarian\" institutions in America (in the early 1930's - imagine that! during the Great Depression... what a coincidence?) started out by popularizing the bombastic flea's work and distributing his books, free, to libraries and schools.\nIt is one heckuva of a story but the whole \"Libertarian\" racket was more crooked than a Ponzi scheme, absolutely manufactured out of whole cloth to oppose socialist ideology and nothing more. It is a designer theory that was designed to fulfill the needs of a free market. The demand was there for an oppositional theory to Marxism, but no supply. You can imagine how high the price was... although it fell right back down to its value when the Universities solved the crisis of production.\nThe reason that Libertarianism is reminiscent of Marxism is that it took it's technique entirely from Marxism but it was born as anti-Marxism or \"Bizzaro Marxism\" (I wasn't just joking about that reference). In fact it is fairly unique among political and economic ideologies in this regard, with only Creationism and a few others of this type coming to mind. Just as with Creationism's battle with Darwin, the Libertarians simply could not accept the direction of Science and set out to overturn it. The pioneer in this space, Carl Menger, was a contemporary of Marx but already saw in the political economy of Adam Smith and David Ricardo the seeds of the Marxist evolution, with Saint-Simon acting as the Nostradamus of the coming storm. Menger's student, Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk wrote the first \"definitive criticism\" of Marx's political economy. The resurrection of Libertarianism in the 1930s was not just in direct response Bolshevism but also to New Deal policies and Keynesianism, which were seen as surrender to \"socialist principles\" and it is not by accident that the doctrine was inextricably linked with Ayn Rand and Joseph McCarthy in post-war America. In all of this, Libertarianism never even found the time to \"revise\" the history of the \"natural evolution\" of Libertarian economics from classical political economy (to which it had previously been uniformly hostile), nor even to \"discover\" an underlying formal \"philosophy\" until the 1970s when Hayek's books were given free by groups like the Olin Foundation to universities in much the same way as Bawerk's had been before.\nVirtually every \"theorist\" of the ideology began as a virulent anti-communist well before they were \"theoreticians,\" Oddly, few of them bother to hide this. Virtually all of them admit to setting out to overturn a science, the implications of which, they simply could not accept. The principle cornerstone of that science inevitably begins with \"The Labor Theory of Value.\" \nwith the attempt to depict Austrian economic theory, and marginalism in general, as fundamentally free of any political taint, Hayek declared (1973):\n\n\"I can find no indication that Jevons, Menger, or Wairas, in their efforts to rebuild economic theory, were moved by any desire to revindicate the practical conclusions that had been drawn from classical economics. Such indications as we have of their sympathies are on the side of the current movements for social reform.\"\n\nHayek here missed the point, however. The question does not concern Austrian (and marginalist) economics as a defense of laissez-faire capitalism against social reform, but as a defense of the basic market economy (private ownership of the means of production) against socialism (collective ownership of the means of production, first by the state and later collectively in a post \"state capitalist\" indeed post-state form when the state has \"withered\" as the bourgeoisie is fully vanquished and only a single class remains). \nHayek ignored the theoretical crisis that existed in economics on the eve to the marginalist revolution (at least in English-speaking countries). Friedrich von Wieser testified to this crisis in his biographical notice on Menger (Wieser 1923). Both he and B\u00f6hm-Bawerk were deeply troubled as they began their careers as economists. Among the problems confronting them were the implications of the classical theory of value. If that theory were true, then:\n\n\"Is not the socialist critique of current conditions, is not Karl Marx with his theory of surplus value, totally correct? Is not socialist theory just the completer of the classical idea, which the classical economists themselves did not have the courage to think out to the end?\"\n\nFrank A. Fetter was another scholar who saw the emergence of marginalism as a deliverance from an ideological dilemma. Fetter (1923) elaborated on the predicament of classical economics after the middle of the nineteenth century. Of Ricardo and his LTV, Fetter stated (1923; see also Ross 1991):\n\n\"...with his sophistical arguments he had given to this really primitive conception the phenomenal authority of his name, and it was to go on exerting a tremendous and evil influence in ways then all unforeseen. Labor is the source of value (exchange value, virtually market price as he used it); labor is the cause of value; labor produces all wealth. Naturally follows the ethical and political conclusion: if labor produces all wealth then labor should receive all wealth...\"\n\nThe science simply could not be left to the scientists. With their search for \"abstract truth,\" they had simply (\"tragically\") justified the revolutionaries... \nNow, to the underlying and really salient question: What is value?\nEverything that is produced by human beings is a \"use value.\" The term is a \"null term\" in effect. A thing would not be produced unless it satisfied some human want or need, real or imagined. Further, its usefulness is a function of the properties of the thing produced. The appropriation of even the simplest elements of nature requires the exertion of labor and thus counts as \"production,\" i.e. it would not occur without some \"use\" as its precondition.\nAny product of labor that enters into exchange acquires a \"value.\" The expression of that value is called an \"exchange-value\" of which one form (that of an exchange value expressed in money) is \"price.\" The process of exchange represents an abstraction away from the physical properties of the products under consideration and thus away from use values as a whole (because use values have no existence apart from the physical properties of the products of human labor). Instead, exchange value and the value underlying it, gauge a social quality that is layered on top of (or \"congealed\" in) the products of human labor when they enter into exchange. This value appears to be no less a property of those products than their physical properties despite the fact that no electron microscope of any intensity has yet been invented that can find a single iota of value in a bar of gold. This is the basis of \"fetishism.\"\nThis attribute of commodities is common to all commodities and thus to all products of human labor intended for exchange, whether or not that exchange is realized and thus all \"intermediate\" goods, industrial capital, etc., also have this character. On occasion, things that are not products of labor may also acquire exchange values but this is mainly an artifact of the surrounding production of commodities. There is also a detailed discussion of this in both Marx and the preceding classical economists.\nThe nature of the labor that makes up \"value\" is that it is labor of a \"peculiar sort,\" according to Marx. It too is abstracted away from the specific physical labor that creates use values. Marx calls it \"abstract social labor\" and it is clearly a social average which reaches across the specific traits of the laborers to achieve an average duration and intensity. It is also a kind of labor which reduces the widely varied skill levels of many types of labor to a common denominator. It is not necessary to debate this as this was \u201cdocumented\u201d in the earliest forms of exchange and has not been challenged in any of the critiques of classical Political Economy. The art critic may argue that there is no commonality whatever between the talent that produces \u201cSofa Art\u201d and the genius of DaVinci, but that same critic has to concede that, to the extent that both paintings are commodities, that \u201ccommonality\u201d is established and reconciled every day (even if it is at a ratio of 1 million to one).\n\nOn further edit regarding the rephrased question: It is certainly popular today to deify Adam Smith as surely \"pro-capitalist\" although in terms of Labor Theory of Value, history has decidedly marked him as otherwise even as the deification contradictorily rolls on.\nBy modern American standards he would be decried as a \"socialist!\" not for LTV (*most folks haven't a clue about it or the marginalism cooked up to replace both Marx and it) but for his other positions:\nIn this era, free-market proponents have been commonly viewed as the intellectual heirs to Adam Smith. But as the Cambridge historian Emma Rothschild has pointed out, Smith was widely regarded as a socialist pioneer until the second half of the 20th century. How socialist? In 1881, Lord Acton had claimed that \"government with the working class was the irresistible consequence of Smith's ideas.\" A 19th-century German economist concurred, writing that Smith was \"the immediate precursor - indeed the champion and pioneer of - socialism,\" adding, with a wry nod to Latin naming, that \"socialism is the pure consequence of Smithianissimus.\" http://www.pimpmyadamsmith.com/ihand.html\n\"The necessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor ... The luxuries and vanities of life occasion the principal expense of the rich, and a magnificent house embellishes and sets off to the best advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which they possess ... It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion.\" - Adam Smith \n"}]}

This cultivation is part of The Way (to enlightenment) and you should keep in mind that the body is an attachment only released at natural death.\nNonetheless, you must relinquish not only \"attachment\" but also attachment to the act of relinquishing attachment.  How?  The understanding comes from insight and wisdom, which harmoniously develop together as you read, contemplate, and meditate the teachings and your own situation.\nReally, the idea of \"attachment\" is at its very base concern for self.  As you live more selflessly, and thrive in the happiness of other sentient beings, it will be easier to detach, as you will increase awareness and mindfulness.\nThere are the precepts, which hold you from wordly and gripping attachments.  By holding the precepts you are slowly released from karmatic bonds that would otherwise prevent you from even being able to understand and look for meaning in the Dharma.  Naturally, you are experiencing a clarity of mind that is well-afforded by virtue and merit, and you should continue to cultivate.\nWhat does it mean to cultivate?\n  In order to relinquish all attachment, one strives with vigilance to see all marks as no marks.  One also strives to relinquish all attachment that is visible from the 'ego' or 'self'.\nThe Buddha taught Dharma because although one is capable of relinquishing attachment to what one directly \"observes,\" one is incapable of relinquishing that which one does not know she/he is clutching.  Your fist is clenched very tightly and you are holding something.  Oh, what a grip!  It is impossible to let go.\nImagine your surprise when your fist unclenches and there is nothing there.  In a similar way, one clings to perception.  The \"information\" from your eyes, nose, tongue, ears, body, and thoughts (as well as emotions) is ephemeral (temporary).  It all passes because it all changes.  Everything changes and nothing is permanent.  To contemplate these thoughts is to contemplate Dharma.\nHow does one let go of \"attachment\" ?  How do you let go of \"letting go\" ?\n\"Letting go\" is just a concept.  Really, there is nothing to let go of because you are not holding on to anything.  The Buddha taught that our clinging is a consequence of Doubt, which arises from causes and conditions.  Doubt is not real, and in trying to avoid doubt (rather than investigate it and understand that it is empty) sentient beings cling to that which feels good and comfortable, and avoid that which is \"bad\" or feels uncomfortable.  Truly, the more comfortable you get at understanding that nothing is comfortable or uncomfortable, the more you will see.\nReally, the attachment to physical objects is coarse.  It is several steps removed from the very basis of attachment, yet they are the same entity.  It is all one entity and it is all no entity, because there is no entity.  Words do not suffice to explain concepts which are only truly received and understood at levels \"between frames of time\" -- as it is necessary for you to observe this \"in motion\" in order to understand what it \"means,\" but the understanding and wisdom that liberates comes from within.\nTrue attachment is not only the physical world -- it is the conceptual world, the emotional world, the perceptual world.  Consider that you are sitting at a \"desk\" -- really it is no desk at all, it is just materials aligned in a configuration -- but again there is no material, it has no inherent existence of its own.  It is constantly in flux and always changing, and your attachment to the label of \"desk\" is merely an attachment.  Naturally, we cannot deny the reality around us, but we can strive toward understanding that it is all one fluid.  Then, pondering that there is no fluid, that we are the fluid.  Understand that there is no separation between \"self\" and \"other\" because we are all one fluid.  \nWith the motivation to be happy and free of attachment, to be free of suffering, it will become more and more effortless to see, feel, understand, and speak true Dharma.  Patience in the ways of suffering is of measureless virtue and merit.  Your mind is brilliant -- like \"a blue sky filled with white light\" -- but it cannot answer a half-baked question.  No matter how correct, if you don't know what you are asking then no answer will be of use to you.  Thus, I recommend working with what you are trying to wrap your head around at the moment, and letting the true question form over time.  In my case, I have found it helpful to ponder and meditate on such things as \"What is attachment?\" -- work with your mind to perceive and exist in the current singular moment.  There is present, past, and future, as is taught in Buddhism, but really you cannot ever truly dwell in the \"past\" or catch up to the \"future\" because all concepts are attachments.\nWhen leaving the world of concepts, recall your ambition to feel happy and to \"embrace\" liberation.  We are all one intellect, striving to unify.  May we all, in the last words of the Buddha (really the physical body is just a form, and death is a transformation), strive with vigilance.\nlove and wisdom, my friend and eternal brother.\n"}]}

If happiness is that thing that every action strives toward, then by definition, every action is motivated by a desire for happiness.\nAlternatively, if one defines happiness without directly referring to it as the intended end of other actions, then a more interesting project can proceed. \nFor example, some evolutionary psychologists might suggest that an increase in the likelihood of the gene is the motivational force behind many (if not every) action. If one identified happiness as the successful reproduction of one's genetic code, and these evolutionary psychologists were correct (which, in my opinion is questionable given the known influence of genetic drift on phenotypes such as behavior), then again this claim is likely true but in a much less uninteresting way.\nIf you wanted to disprove it, however, this would also require defining happiness. For example @Keith statements above are only true if biological need is not a subset of \"happiness\". If happiness is merely \"the motivation of every man['s actions]\", then the tautology still holds and if @Keith's statements are true, then either biological need should be thought of a subset of happiness, or a contradiction is reached.\n"}]}

Even knowing that having that extra piece of cake will make you feel miserable, you can't stop yourself.\nDrug users have more counter-examples. Caffeine makes many people more motivated, but doesn't appear to increase satisfaction once the task you were motivated to do is complete.\nAt a more physical level, this can be seen as a result of the fact that multiple neurotransmitters are responsible for \"motivation\" and \"happiness.\" The reason you want to have sex is probably due to your dopamine levels; the reason you feel happy after having sex is probably more related to oxytocin. As Wikipedia says:\n\nDopamine's role in experiencing pleasure has been questioned by several researchers. It has been argued that dopamine is more associated with anticipatory desire and motivation (commonly referred to as \"wanting\") as opposed to actual consummatory pleasure (commonly referred to as \"liking\").\n\nThis is a place where we might need to look closely at Aristotle's definition of \"eudaimonia.\" Eating until you're sick might increase short-term pleasure, but decrease long-run pleasure. Is that eudaimonic? I think the usual definition would say no, but Pascal might say yes - I'm not familiar with his philosophy.\nThe difficulty with defining \"happiness\" in a reasonable way is one of the reasons why contemporary philosophers frequently focus on preference satisfaction instead.\n\nEDIT: To summarize: inject someone with dopamine.

As soon as I'm saying all behavior originates from one single thing, then that one single thing wouldn't seem able to really explain particular behaviors very well anymore. In other words, if every act aims at x, then x becomes so broad as to encompass all action by definition -- we have lost the meaning of x. \nAfter all, are mourning or crying motivated by happiness? Pascal's example may seem particularly bizarre in this light when he claims that even suicide is motivated by happiness.\nThat being said, I definitely and wholeheartedly agree with the claim at least in the sense that I do take this to be a strong empirical rule-of-thumb regarding human psychology. It's in this sense that I might suggest we could read Pascal's claim, noting in passing the intended irony when he suggests that even those who hang themselves serve their own happiness. At the very least, then, it doesn't seem to be the same happiness in all cases that is served -- we have to look deeper, at least down to way of the life, to get a sense of what kind of happiness we are dealing with. There are some happinesses only possible on condition of an unhappy life.\n\nUPDATE: With respect to your clarification, I certainly agree indeed that the context of the problem of happiness is ethics. In particular, I submit that the kernel of the problem is that even though we agree human nature aims at happiness, that there are necessarily very different qualities of happiness for different ways of life.\nIn other words my suggestion is that some actions, passions, expressions, values are only possible on condition of a 'low' or 'base' way of thinking and living. I am even tempted to claim this may even indicate the critical dimension of philosophy itself, in a way -- to identify the difference between \"high\" and \"low\" thought, to rigorously establish the spiritual distance between \"base\" and \"noble\" ways of living. We need to distinguish critical, ethically significant variations in the quality of happiness being served in particular instances.\n(Note: I am not an expert on Aristotle.)\n"}]}

He became the object of severe criticism and ridicule for denying what seemed most obvious to anyone. Berkeley had set out to deny the existence of matter.\nSince the science of his day, particularly physics, relied so heavily on the notion of matter, Berkeley had to come to terms with its assumptions and methods. Science had assumed that we can, and must, distinguish appearance and reality. Locke had said that substance, or matter, supports or acts a substitute for the qualities we sense. \nIn Berkeley\u2019s \u201cFirst Dialogue between Hylas and Philonus\u201d, Hylas expresses Locke\u2019s view: \u201cI find it necessary to suppose a material substratum, without which [qualities] cannot be conceived to exist.\u201d Philonus replies that the word substratum has no clear meaning for him and that he would want to \u201cknow any sense, literal or not literal, that you understand in it.\u201d But Hylas admits that he cannot assign any definite meaning to the term substratum, saying \u201cI declare I know not what to say.\u201d \nFrom this the conclusion is drawn that \u201cthe absolute existence of unthinking things [matter] are words without meaning.\u201d This is not to say that sensible things do not possess reality but only that sensible things exist only insofar as they are perceived. This, of course, implies that only ideas exist, but Berkeley adds that \u201cI hope that to call a thing \u2018idea\u2019 makes it no less real.\u201d\nHis influence was nevertheless significant, but it was his empiricism and not his idealism that had a lasting influence. Building on Locke\u2019s empiricism, Berkeley made the decisive point that the human mind reasons only and always about particular sense experiences \u2013 that abstract ideas refer to no equivalent reality. \nHume, who was to carry empiricism to its fullest expression, spoke of Berkeley as:  \n\n\u201ca great philosopher [who] has\n  disputed the received opinion in this\n  particular, and has asserted that all\n  general ideas are nothing but\n  particular ones.

Some very famous contemporary papers which invoke Berkelely that spring to mind include Kripke's 'On Rules and Private Language', Cora Diamond's 'Realism and Realistic Spirit' and Putnam's passage 'Berkeley's Tour de Force' in his Reason, History and Truth.  Berkeley is always cited in all these places as as an example of someone who, though not wholly successful, made one of the greatest and most influential attempts to address matters which remain central philosophical concerns to this day.\nI think if Berekely somehow travelled through time and turned up at a convention of contemporary philosophers, he would not be shunned as someone out of favour, but welcomed with open arms and feted with ecstatic praise, and everyone would want to talk to him!\n"}]}

But the problem with his argument is that his perceiving is actually connected with something. By which I mean, he could not perceive a piano in his study without someone building it first and then placing it there.\nAdmittedly, he could argue that the building and delivering of the piano was something he perceived and is thus also in his mind but you can't just sit there, perceiving new things instantly into reality.

But they are also of such a kind that it cannot be said that it is unreasonable to believe them. Thus there is both evidence and obscurity to enlighten some and confuse others. \n\nTherefore, his view of the Christian scriptures is that a rational agent could reasonably believe or disbelieve the \"proofs of our religion\".  This is also the view of Alvin Plantinga and it seems the authors of the Bible as well.\n\nOther religions, particularly Islam, believe that their scripture is self-validating:\n\nSurely, any sincere and unbiased searcher of truth will come to believe that the Qur'an is the revealed Book of Allah.\n\nHere's an example of the argument:\n\n\"The above observation makes the hypothesis advanced by those who see Muhammad as the author of the Qur'an untenable. How could a man, from being illiterate, become the most important author, in terms of literary merits, in the whole of Arabic literature? How could he then pronounce truths of a scientific nature that no other human being could possibly have developed at that time, and all this without once making the slightest error in his pronouncement on the subject?\"\nMaurice Bucaille, THE BIBLE, THE QUR'AN AND SCIENCE, 1978, p. 125.\n\nI don't have any particular evidence that people who believe these sorts of statements are not rational beings.  My personal experience with people who make these claims is that they are rational.  It would be unfair of me to claim they are irrational so that I can dismiss their claims as irrational.\n\nI believe that I am a rational agent. I believe the Christian scriptures were \"breathed out by God\", which doesn't quite mean they were written by God, but that they were directly inspired by him.  This isn't really the time or place to defend that belief, but the basic outline looks like this:\n1) The Bible, when it treats historical subjects, broadly reflects historical reality.\n2) The historical events treated by the Bible, particularly in the life and death of Jesus, are strong evidence of a God not anticipated or invented by humanity.\n3) History since the events of the Bible shows rational men and women clinging to their belief in the truth of the Bible even to the point of death.\nI don't expect anyone to be persuaded by this sort of argument (point #1 would probably be impossible to prove to someone who firmly rejects the Bible), but I would hope other rational agents could imagine how I might rationally be convinced of this.  \n\nUpdate: To answer JDH's comment, there are essentially two questions that I see: the explicit and the implied.  The answer to the explicit question seems to be \"No\".  (Other answers bare that out, I believe.)  For the Bible, at least, there's even an expectation that it will be seen as foolish:\n\nFor Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. -- 1 Corinthians 1:22-24 (ESV)\n\nThat's a restatement of the first section above.\nBut there is also an implied question: \"If there's nothing that can written in a text that would convince a rational person that it was written by a god, can a rational person believe a text was written by a god?\"  It is a question of what Dr. Plantinga calls Warrant which loosely defined is that property that separates knowledge from belief.  One might extrapolate that since evidence for god-inspired texts isn't absolutely convincing, that belief in god-inspired texts isn't warranted.   \nI pointed out in the second section, that some do hold that some holy texts are self-validating, but you can't dismiss the claim out of hand.  The specific evidence for the claim must be dealt with.  It would be invalid to hold that people who believe a particular text is god-inspired can be written off as arational agents.  I think the evidence for the Qur'an is a bit thin, but until I deal with it directly, I can't say that belief in its god-inspired status is unwarranted.  That would be an invalid shortcut.\nThe third section deals with my personal belief.  I'd be happy to defend it1, but it would be time-consuming and of perhaps limited interest.  Even though I feel the evidence is strong, I know that each step would be hotly contested and at the end of the day, my view would be rejected by some (and probably all who don't already agree with me).  But the point is the evidence itself must be evaluated, not the person making the claim.\n\nFootnote:\n\nI've started my defense of the first point about the historical reliably at the Skeptics site.\n\n"}]}

A rational decision is one that is not just reasoned, but is also optimal for achieving a goal or solving a problem. - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality\n\nSuppose someone offered you a billion dollars to believe that the moon was made out of cheese. It would be perfectly rational for you to start believing in the cheese-moon hypothesis, assuming you valued the billion dollars more than you valued the 'truth'. \nSo what would it take for a rational agent to believe God wrote a book? Like everything else, the solution is large sums of money.\n\nA harder question to answer would revolve around defining 'truth'. We might suggest that to assert \"X is true\" means something like \"it is useful for one to believe X\". We could point to an increased sense of community among believers, for example, as evidence that belief in a divine being is useful and therefore true. This is a (poorly phrased version of a) tack that James took.\n\nAnd of course there's the nuclear option - denying the value of \"truth\". Consider the Knight of Faith. One of my favorie Kierkegaard lines:\n\nKierkegaard uses the story of a princess and a man who is madly in love with her, but circumstances are that the man will never be able to realize this love in this world ever... The knight of faith would say \"I believe nevertheless that I shall get her, in virtue, that is, of the absurd, in virtue of the fact that with God all things are possible.\" This double movement is paradoxical because on the one hand it is humanly impossible that they would be together, but on the other hand the knight of faith is willing to believe that they will be together through divine possibility.

This sentence has a universal quantification that can not be checked empirically, so we need to argue that logically. To do this we need to use what we know about God and argue that no one not satisfying those conditions could have written the book, or at least show that this is very unlikely. Most arguments would only show that the prover has certain properties, but this may not mean that the prover is really God, e.g. it does not rule out directly the possibility that it is written by an alien creature with super-human powers.\nSame with verifier, our rational person. What kind of actions that person can perform? What are his assumptions about the properties that God has? etc.\nThe kind of interaction is also important. Sending a book or a written text is one possibility, but there can be more complicated interactions, e.g. other kind of miracles. A text by itself can be a miracle and theoretically a proof that the other party posses very high computational power that is unimaginable that a human can have (here we need to argue what are the capabilities of a human being). It is plausible that the prover is capable of solving a computationally undecidable problem, a problem that we know no computer can solve. But the verifier needs to be able to check the correctness of the proof. A more interesting case is for example a problem that does not have simple algorithms to find an answer but if given an answer the verifier can check its correctness (a.k.a. an NP-complete problem in computer science). If we repeat this process enough times we can be sure that the other party is capable of solving NP-complete problems very quickly, and if you believe in something like Extended Church-Turing thesis, then that should be very convincing.\nInterestingly the proof can be very personal and not intersubjective, i.e. God can convince you that a book is from him, but you cannot show this fact to any third party (this is what is called a Zero-Knowledge proof in computer science).\nI concentrated on the computational power of God, but one can use other capabilities of God that the verifier believes no one else is capable of like omniscience or omnipotence, e.g. if God raises mount Sinai over my head and I hear a voice that says Torah is from God a few thousands years ago, I would be convinced (though others might not since they believe that what they see and hear is not enough, it might be magic or something).\nInteraction can increase the possibility of a proof considerably, i.e. it is much easier to convince if there is a two-way communication, e.g. verifier asks questions or make requests and God answers them. A book can perform as a common knowledge between two parties. For example, if the book is very long and although contains an answer to a question, finding it might be impracticable. But the verifier can ask for a proof of say NP!=P and God would say look at page X of the book. This is probably going to be a much shorter communication than a full proof of P!=NP (you can interpret this as what some people consider signs from God which directs them to answers to their problems or questions). \nI again focused on computational power of a human, but if a verifier has other capabilities they can be used also, they don't need to be computational. \nThe previous part deals with what is called authentication, it does not mean that the book has not been altered, i.e. its integrity.\nOne last point. Most rationals have been heavily influenced by science and only accept arguments that look scientific and are intersubjective. Say a personal interaction with God which is not intersubjective and reproducible might not convince such persons. Also arguments which appeal to other capabilities of humans which science does not understand well at the moment, a poem or a picture or a natural even can have a very strong effect on a human, but because science does not certify it they would reject that as a reasonable argument. But it seems that the sender/author of books like Torah or Quran does not share their idea and values psychological and literatural effect more than a scientific argument, maybe it is because science changes too quickly too much, or probably he has a better understanding of how a human-being's mind works. Probably, these books should be analyzed from that perspective.\n"}]}

Anything that can be understood (not to mention validated) by the quite limited humen intellect certainly would not require an infinite intellect to produce (assuming for the sake of the argument that the term \"infinite intellect\" even makes sense). A very powerful AI capable of simulating a huge number of human beings could, for example, produce every string which is short enough for a human to read in its lifetime, then simulate all the efforts humans could muster to validate such texts, and throw away those which the simulated humans would not find godlike, thereby producing a godlike text (if one exists at all) while not being God.\nOn the other hand, it is not hard to imagine a book which could not have been written by a human being. One which asks you on the first page to get a coin and lists the results of your coin throws on the next few hundred pages would suffice.

This means that there are no incidents, in history or experience, where two humans have ever disagreed about what the book says or how to apply what it says to a given situation.\nThe book is not published by any known human agent, but it exists anyway, and no human is ever unable to obtain a copy.

So it's written by a being that is at least godlike.\n\nAn edit, based on muz's comment. It occurs to me that the questioner mentions \"a god\" as opposed to \"God\". In that case I suppose we could have many such books, and the best way for a rational person to be convinced that it was written by a god would be for the god to claim credit. For example, if there actually were an Athena and her powers and attributes were sufficient to demonstrate her godlike nature, then if she appeared on the Daily Show to promote her book, there wouldn't be a rational reason to doubt that she wrote it.\nMy first answer is based on the assumption that the book itself has to be proof of the existence of the god in question.\n\nA further edit in response to sehe's comment. The properties I'm listing in my first answer are not properties of an intangible thing, or forces of nature like gravity. I'm saying that in order for a book to convince a rational person that it was written by a god, the book itself--the thing written on parchment, stone tablets, clay, or other media--would have to have those properties. I'm saying that if I wanted to read part of the Book, I would have to be able to reach out into thin air and conjure a copy of the Book, and that I couldn't conjure any other book. That's criteria 4. Criteria 3 means that whenever humans discuss the book, they agree. No exceptions, not even between teenagers and parents. \nThe book is also a source of unlimited electrical power, because it can be conjured and burned indefinitely, but depending on the contents people might or might not do this.\n"}]}

This kind of logic in the Quran is a higher order logic. Quran does not ask for a blind faith. Quran wants the believers to examine the facts and then make a decision to accept or reject. So, my advice to you if you want to know, read Quran and make up your mind about who wrote the book.\nHere is my own experience. I consider my self a rational man of science and I earned my PhD in computer engineering. Every time I read Quran I get more convinced that Quran is not written by any human and Quran is the words of Allah, my creator.\nOne such example of knowledge of the type you are looking for in the Quran is the statement of the Quran that everything is created in pairs which is only understood just recently when we discovered that elementary particles come in pairs which we call matter and antimatter. For instance, electron and positron pair.\nIf Quran was from any source other than Allah (God) then we would find many logical contradictions. These contradictions could be internal between different parts of Quran or external with indisputable facts. For instance, many claimed that there are contradictions in Quran. For example, they cite that Quran states that ants talk to each other in the story of Prophet Solomon with ants( Ants chapter, verse 18). Just recently, scientists discovered in 2009 that ants \"talk\" to each other using sound produced by its abdomen. See this ABC News clip about the discovery.\n"}]}

The purpose of HNL is to help humans to accomplish human goals, which include acquiring resources, social stability, happiness of self/friends/family, and protection against threats, mostly other humans.\nUnlike formal languages, HNL has no clear and precise common basis crucial for reliable communication as in math and science. Mental representation of concepts, words and meanings depend on one's personal, family, and cultural history. HNL is not truth or false-preserving and so it's easy to make anything sound true or false. We use it because everyone can learn it, false ideas can have enormous benefits, it's too hard to find a valid proof or teach everyone how to use a more appropriate language, and it has great manipulative power.\nHNL does not exist to find a clear, explicit, truthful, unbiased, minimal representation of how the universe works (sometimes it's the opposite because humans thrive on mystery and stories). That's the goal of science, and that's why science uses formal languages. HNL is completely inappropriate for representing truth.\nThe most well developed of technologies is psychological and social control through language. Humans have spent tens of thousands of years refining ways to control other humans and we are easily fooled. Using HNL, religious texts are optimized to activate certain human instincts that are difficult to control. A tactic used by the Quran, Bible and salesmen is to put the listener in a certain mindset (thinking about loved ones or punishment for example), which restricts their thought process making it very difficult to think clearly. Another tactic is to use a chain of low probability or unverifiable, contingent \"what if\" events that lead to a psychologically appealing end. There are many more very effective methods to covertly inject bias into a human's thought process using HNL because that is one of its most valuable uses.\nRationality is relative to an agent's goals and current knowledge of its environment which its idea of truth often contradicts. Thus humans have evolved to cope well with contradictions, by using faith for example. What goals does a healthy, rational human usually have? To find the truth no matter how painful, destructive, possibly disrupting peace, inciting anarchy, or to survive while maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain?\nThe concept of god(s) is a deeply rooted primal instinct that probably originated from living under and being dependent upon a chieftain, tribal elders or some type of primate leader for millions of years. In all cultures god (or a perfect leader) is a crucial part of a species-wide self control mechanism, so tightly coupled with social stability and personal well-being that all atheists and agnostics (relative to the god of the culture they live in) recognize the danger in announcing their beliefs.\nA basic requirement for me is that the text would have to be written in some kind of precise, explicit formal language that is not biased toward humans. Hopefully, I will know enough true facts about the universe already that I can use as a key to decipher the language. It must successfully address the problems with HNL stated above. It would contain all conceivable knowledge, address all valid open questions (it will likely show most questions to be nonsense) and be brutally honest. It can't appear to be concerned with the fate of humanity or morality and it can't be selling a way of life or a way to get anything humans need or want, other than clearly describing the nature of god and the universe. It can say how humans are different but not \"special\". It will read like a math or science book and some parts will take years to understand. Most of it will be out of reach of my primitive hominid mind. It must not \"reek\" of humanity or contain stories like most texts, or have any hint of human-like psychology (other than describing explicitly how humans or aliens behave). This may exclude the possibility of a caring, theistic god who would not want such dangerous knowledge to be in my hands. \n"}]}

I may then conclude \"experience is the best evidence.\"\nBut, how do I share that experience with another who has not experienced the same thing? \"Experience\" suddenly goes from being \"best evidence\" to being \"subjective claim.\" And may even go from \"subjective claim\" to \"Misinterpretation of events.\" I would need to be almost an expert in some field in order to properly apply the interpretation of events into a proper application of facts, in order to reach a proper conclusion about the meaning of anything, from stimuli, to the meaning of my (subjective) reactions to stimuli, before I could communicate to another, just exactly what it was by which I was \"stimulated.\"\nBut one thing I know, My \"experience\" is really that something took place \"as I understand it.\"\nSo I then begin to look for a way to share my \"experience\" in a way that removes all doubt that the event took place, and that its ramifications are in line with my understanding of what they mean. How to share THAT becomes my goal.\nSo I begin to testify as to every aspect of my experience, and tell loud and long about what it is that I perceive took place, only to have someone respond, \"Yes, that looks like what happened, but how do we know you didn't write about it from someone else's record of events. In other words, how do we know it was YOU who experienced it? And if YOU did not experience it, but only recorded it for our information, how do we know it even happened according to your testimony? So, testimony may be better than experience, but still does not satisfy as \"best evidence.\" There must be something more ABOUT testimony that presents itself as \"best evidence.\"\nI then inquire into \"kinds\" of testimony; there must be a certain kind of testimony that serves as \"best evidence\" for sharing an experience. Immediately I think \"of course, it must be \"first hand\" testimony. \"Eye witness\" testimony become the focus of my search, only to have someone point out, \"yes, eye witness testimony certainly beats second or third party testimony, known as \"hearsay\" evidence, but what if you have conflicting testimony from several \"eye\" witnesses? Back to the drawing board.\nO.K. What if I describe events AS THEY HAPPEN, is that not equivalent to letting you share in reality? Does that not consist of \"proof?\" Well, not quite. THAT assumes the accuracy of my subjective reporting of events, as being objectively reporting. In other words, do I allow my own prejudices to color my reporting? Is my reporting \"subjective\" or is it \"objective?\"\nSuppose I discover a way to share with you an event that has not yet happened? I find a way to include details that are easy to look for? I even name names of persons that do not yet exist? Suppose that event takes place generations later, and the person involved has the name I said he would have, and the events happen as I outlined them in the telling?\nTHAT WOULD BE THE BEST EVIDENCE.\nI tell you of an event that will take place two hundred years in the future, name the person involved, tell you what he will do, and even convince HIM, the person I name, that I am real BECAUSE I could name him well in advance of the factual demonstration.\nAN ACTUAL HISTORICAL EVENT\nOne who said \"I AM GOD,\" named a man who is going to allow the children of Israel to return from captivity, Over two hundred years before he was born. But the children of Israel were not even IN captivity when God wrote about it. They had no reason to believe they would BE in captivity for they were not even at war with anybody when it was written.\nGod told about a king that would send the children of Israel back to Jerusalem, to rebuild the temple, which at the time of writing had not even been destroyed. They would also rebuild the walls of the city, which at the time of writing had not been destroyed.\nWhat is the best evidence? \"FORETELLING IN DETAIL\" of events not remotely likely to happen, is the best evidence that God wrote the bible. If He can produce statements about a foreign king sending the children of Israel back to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple, not yet destroyed, and rebuild the walls of the city, not yet destroyed, and name the foreign king by name, there is no evidence stronger among men.\nGod named Cyrus, king of Persia, as his \"anointed,\"\nBeginning in Isaiah 44:28 Jehovah God said of Cyrus, king of Persia -\n\"He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.\n\"Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;  2 I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron: 3 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.\"[Isa 45:1-3]\nAFTER NAMING CYRUS, GOD TELLS WHY HE NAMED HIM.\n\"For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me. 5 I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: 6 THAT THEY MAY KNOW from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I AM JEHOVAH [THE LORD], and there is none else.[Isa 45:4-6]\nNo other God named among men has EVER performed such a happening. There is no religion among men who has a God who could do such a thing. ONLY Jehovah, The God of Israel, ever told events two hundred years prior to the happening, and told the name of the one who would perform the act.\nTHAT is not only the \"best evidence\" because it not only can be expected by later generations, it can be verified as to accuracy, and it can be witnessed by doubters, and proved to THEIR satisfaction, leaving no doubt remaining. CYRUS king of Persia was convinced, as were the children of Israel.\nPRETESTIMONY is the best evidence. God pretestified as to the events, the person, the how, the when, and the why. ANY God who can do THAT, has the right to tell us of man's origins, and how we should respond to the reality of who and what we are, as God's image.\nAnd He even tells us of the inspiration aspect of the book authored by Him - \nDeuteronomy 18:18 - \"I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, (Moses) and will put MY WORDS in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I command him.\"\nIsaiah 51:16 states - \"And I have put MY WORDS in thy mouth...\"\nJeremiah 1:9 Then the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the Lord said unto me, \"Behold, I have put my (logos) WORDS in thy mouth.\" Many other verses proclaim the same thing; It is God's word that the prophets proclaimed.\nConcerning what was written, Exo 24:4 says, \"And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord...\" and verse 12; And the Lord said unto Moses, come up to me into the mount, and be there. And I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I HAVE WRITTEN; that thou mayest teach them. And Exo 31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, WRITTEN WITH THE FINGER OF GOD. Exo 34:27 And the Lord said unto Moses, WRITE THOU THESE WORDS: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. With MANY other words, God testifies as to his authorship of his book. So, God tells us he wrote the bible, and who is there among us who can \"prove\" that NOT to be the case?\nLater testimony of eye-witnesses verified to the minutia of detail that was fulfilled.

So, if A being true means B must be true, then A is in some sense the cause of B (I realize that the whole correlation versus causation problem comes up here, but I am only trying to provide a rough model). \nFor example, suppose that at some time t we have a big spherical mass M (event A), and from a distance r away you (mass m) experience a real force equal to GMm/r^2 (event B). In this case, A implies B by Newtonian gravity. However, B does not imply A: there could instead be a number of different masses that happen to produce that force.\nFor your example specifically, I think it is important to flesh out the definitions. We say that real force causes acceleration inversely proportional to mass. Fictitious force, on the other hand, is caused by acceleration on a frame (which is caused by a real force or another fictitious force). So, if for that example we have a real force on an object and an acceleration in that object simultaneously, the real force implies an acceleration, but the acceleration does not imply a real force: it implies either a real force or a fictitious force. If instead we have a fictitious force on an object and an acceleration on that object's frame simultaneously, the fictitious force does not imply an acceleration on that specific frame (it could be any frame that happens to contain the object), while the acceleration on the frame does imply a fictitious force on the object. This may seem a bit picky, but pickyness can make all the difference when you're talking about simultaneous events.\nI think this is the crucial difference between cause and effect: not temporal separation, but material implication.

If you consider quantum theory as a language designed to give a grasp of natural phenomena, you may say any ontological model of this theory should be compatible with metaphysical claims of our theory of language. \nOn the other hand Kochen-Specker theorem (and later more generalised by Rob Spekkens) proves that it is required for quantum mechanics to be contextual.

It is possible for the concept usually described by the vastly unspecific and overgeneralized word \"science\" to address religious issues - though it's unlikely. In particular, if a god or gods were to appear, demonstrate their powers, and the like, then it is not the case that the scientific community would still refute this.\nIn some freshman physics class I took in college, I remember there being a student who had a really hard time separating the concept of theory and fact. Really, he had a hard time acknowledging that 'science' was not based on facts, but on approximated theories founded upon approximate observations - they can compete, multiple theories can both be brought forward, etc.\nWhat I'm getting at is that the idea of a 'scientific perspective' seems poorly defined. If you mean from the perspective of coming up with ideas and subjecting them to the test of being compared with observation and logic, then that's one thing. If you mean describe the sort of deity-like perhaps-sentient Designer(s) with a set of rules governing behavior, or to mathematically demonstrate sort of property, or to see what would happen if we shot two of such creators at each other (as I continue to poke at my physics buddies) - that's another thing.\nFurther, it's not so clear what you mean by intelligent design, or even intelligence?

It seems that your question can be more simply reformulated as:\n\nIs belief in religious dogma a necessary consequence of belief in intelligent design?\n\nYou have defined intelligent design as a property of a universe in a state that was caused by a directed process.  You used the term \"intelligent cause\", which is a bit redundant, but the contrast to \"an undirected process, such as natural selection\" elucidates the definition.  So, we can again reformulate the question as:\n\nIs belief in religious dogma a necessary consequence of belief that the state of the universe was caused by a directed process?\n\nI think we can summarize the belief in religiously-dogmatic cosmology, as a \"belief that the state of the universe was caused by God\".  So, our next reformulation is:\n\nIs a belief that the state of the universe was caused by God a necessary consequence of a belief that the state of the universe was caused by a directed process?\n\nIf God is the only possible directed process, then the answer to the question is Yes.  If God is not the only possible directed process, then the directed process that caused the state of the universe could be God or it could be the other thing(s), so the answer to the question is No.  So, you're question can be further reduced to:\n\nIs God the only possible directed process that could cause the state of the universe?\n\nI can conceive of directed processes that could cause the state of the universe, that are as plausible as a dogmatic, religious God, so I tend to think the answer to your question is that Intelligent design does not require religion.  \nConsider a computer chess game.  It executes particular processes (moves) in a directed manner (directed towards winning the chess game).  I don't think that the computer game is a God, (nor the computer programmer), but it is certainly creating a directed process.  This occurs in the physical world, due to a specific configuration of matter that forces electric signals to execute within the parameters of a defined algorithm.  \nGiven that if there is something, it must be somewhere, it is certainly conceivable that when whatever was here before what is here now was here, it was aligned in such a way that some impulse could cause it to emit a \"directed process\".  This is analogous to a mouse click in the universe of the computer running the chess program.  This vague example at least gives an example of what a \"non-religious\" explanation for intelligent design would look like.  \nOne potential counterargument that I anticipate, would be the contention, that any such impulse or configuration of matter is itself God.  But, in order for that argument to hold, the objector would have to start a religion that defines God as such and cultivate a following that accepts it as religious dogma.  \nSo,\nNo\nIntelligent design does not need religion.\n"}]}

Most people would call an intelligence that has the capacity to do something like that a \"God\", but that is a question of definition. You could reasonably say that \"God\" would only apply to the creator of the universe, and the intelligence that designed life does not need to be the same. God could for example delegate it to a sub-god, what in Christianity is called \"Angels\". But then it still needs God. \nA God would only not be needed if there is no God that created the universe, but life then was created by some non-supernatural, but non-living being. This is nearly impossible to imagine, and I would think most people would agree to call an non-living (possibly eternal) and powerful intelligence a \"God\", even if it isn't a God over all of creation.\nDoes then God need religion? Well, depends on your definition of religion. Many would say that any belief in a God constitutes a religion. But if God was proven to exist, we wouldn't believe, we would know, and it would not be religion, but as long as God was unproven, it would be religion. I'm in the camp of \"religion\" meaning that you rely on faith even when faith contradicts logic and/or facts.\nDoes then Intelligent Design need religion? \nWell, it needs religion as long as God hasn't been shown to exist, as it then relies entirely on faith, in the face of facts and better explanations (evolution). But if God does exist, it doesn't need religion, it only needs somebody to prove God (good luck!)\nBasically you can say that Intelligent Design stops needing religion once it's proven that God exists and designed life. Up until then, it needs it.\nSo Yes, Intelligent Design needs religion with common definitions of the words. It needs it to be believed in, to exist if you want. But there are no generally accepted definition of religion/God so it all depends. :-)\n(Update: Note that having believers to not mean it becomes more correct.

That massive continuous theme is the priority and independence of logical structures and rules of inference from the contexts of ordinary understanding.

The ideal or \"hope\" of the intrinsic intelligibility of structures apart from \"all sorts of extraneous elements\" is the same animus that propelled the Vienna Circle. Ricoeur, in several of his essays, has drawn the clearest implications of this position. For him, the goals of structuralism can be accomplished, in fact already have been, but at a price the structuralists ignore. The conditions which make the enterprise possible\u2014the establishment of operations and elements, and an algebra of their combinations\u2014assure from the beginning and by definition that one is working on a body of material which is reconstituted, stopped, closed, and in a certain sense, dead.[19] The very success of structuralism leaves behind the \"understanding of action, operations and process, all of which are constitutive of meaningful discourse. Structuralism seals its formalized language off from discourse, and therefore from the human world.[20] A high price indeed for the sciences of man, although one the structuralists are explicitly willing to pay in the name of science.[21] (12\u201313)\n\n[19] See Paul Ricoeur, \"Structure, Word, Event\" in Conflict of Interpretations: Essays in Hermeneutics (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1974), 79.\n[20] Ibid.\n[21] An enterprise such as that of Jacques Derrida might be termed a \"poststructuralism\" which conceives an absolute text that refers only to itself and consists in the endless play of signifiers in a closed and again ultimately dead and meaningless system. See Jacques Derrida, \"Structure, Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences,\" in The Structuralist Controversy: The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man, ed.

I next wish to show that the very success of this undertaking entails (as a counterpart) an elimination from structural thinking of any understanding of the acts, operations, and processes that constitute discourse. Structuralism leads to thinking in an antinomic way about the relation between language and speech. I will make the sentence or utterance [\u00e9nonc\u00e9] the pivot of this second investigation.

For example: from P & ~P, everything follows, P v ~P is a logical truth, and quantification (statements like 'There is an x such that Fx' and 'For all x ....) range only over objects (hence 'FO'). \nThere are various extensions of CFOL.\nHigher order logics allow one to quantify over properties of objects (Second Order Logic), or properties of properties (Third Order Logic), etc. SOL is needed to state the full generality of the principle of mathematical induction in arithmetic, to articulate a formal theory of arithmetic such that the natural numbers are (up to isomorphism) the unique model of the theory, and to state in full generality Leibniz's laws of identity. For each order above first, there are alternative semantics available which induce different rules of inference.\nThere are various modal logics, which add operators for notions like metaphysical possibility and necessity, temporal relations, epistemic notions, and notions of permissibility and obligatoriness. Even for metaphysical necessity (likely the best studied modal logic), there are multiple logics available, depending on the underlying view about the relationships between possibility and necessity.)\nThere are also many restrictions of CFOL.\nIntuitionistic logic gives up on the general truth of P v ~P, doesn't in general allow you to conclude P from Q & ~Q (though ~P still follows), and treats quantification somewhat differently.\nRelevant logics require more for the truth of P --> Q than the CL condition that either P is false or Q is true in order to avoid the paradoxes of material implication.

These are not in general classifiable as restrictions or extensions of CFOL; it depends upon the details of the particular multi-valued logic.\nThat is just a very quick (hand-wavy, really) survey of some of the better know alternatives to CFOL.

One could easily argue that a person can live a good life, independently of virtue, simply by providing examples of individuals who have a \"good life\" but who are not virtuous.  However, if you are using the phrase \"living a good life\" to explicitly mean \"achieve eudaimonia\", then an individual cannot achieve eudaimonia without virtue.\nAs you seem to be aware, there are multiple conceptions of eudaimonia.  The three best documented views are those of the Stoics, Artistole and Epicurus.  I will quickly summarize their views as relevant to your question:\n\nthe Stoics: Virtue is necessary and sufficient to achieve eudaimonia.  The Stoics believed that eudaimonia cannot be achieved without virtue.\nAristotle:  Aristotle addresses your question in Book I of the Nicomachean Ethics.  You can read the complete text at http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.1.i.html .  In summary, Aristotle believes that virtue is necessary, but not sufficient because \"good fortune\" is an additional requirement for achieving eudaimonia.  Just like the Stoics, Aristotle believed that eudaimonia cannot be achieved without virtue.\nEpicurus:  Epicureanism is the closest we will come to a eudaimonia that can be achieved without virtue, but even his Hedonistic philosophy requires virtue to achieve eudaimonia.  According to Epicurus, eudaimonia is achieved by successfully pursuing and maximizing pleasure.  The catch is that the only way to successfully pursue and maximize one's pleasure is to practice virtue.  In Epicureanism, virtue is nothing more than a means to an end, but it is the only possible means, so it is still a necessary condition of eudaimonia.  \n\nBelow, I have included two passages from a paper I wrote in 2008.  These passages contain a much more in depth explanation of Aristotelian eudaimonism and Epicureanism, as well as documentation and reference to primary sources.\nExcerpt from On the Compatibility of Kantian Ethics and Aristotelian Eudaimonism\nThis content is fully copyright protected.  The first excerpt is from the section explaining Aristotle's eudaimonism.  The unspecified citations that appear refer to Terrence Irwin and Gail Fine's translation of Nicomachean Ethics.  The second excerpt is a discussion of Epicureanism in contrast to Aristotelian eudaimonism.  \nOn Aristotelian Eudaimonism\n\nEudaimonism is the set of ethical theories that consider eudaimonia to be the highest good and advocate its pursuit as right moral action.  Eudaimonia is a Greek word, which translates most closely to happiness.  However, \"happiness\" is an insufficient and incomplete characterization of the concept.  Aristotle says that \"most people virtually agree about what the good is, since both the many and cultivated call it happiness, and suppose that living well and doing well are the same as being happy.  But they disagree about what happiness is, and the many do not give the same answer as the wise.\"  Clearly, there is disagreement among eudaimonist theories as to what exactly eudaimonia is.  The main points to understand are that eudaimonia is the word used to describe the highest good in all eudaimonist theories, that there are various conflicting conceptions of eudaimonia and that \"happiness\" is the English word to which most often eudaimonia is translated.  The focus of this discussion will now shift to a discussion of Aristotle's conception of eudaimonia.\nAristotle views eudaimonia as the activity of \"living well\" and \"doing well\".  It is not a mental state of satisfaction that one achieves by such activities, but the conscious activity itself.  Eudaimonia has the characteristic of being the good at which all other goods aim.  He calls eudaimonia \"the highest of all realizable goods\" and asserts that \"the best of all things must...be something final\" (I, 4).  All other good things, such as \"honour and pleasure and reason, and all virtues or excellence, we choose partly indeed for themselves...but partly also for the sake of happiness, supposing that they will help to make us happy\" (I, 7).  Aristotle contrasts seeking these goods with seeking eudaimonia, which \"no one chooses... as a means to anything else at all\" (I, 7).  So, all other goods are, at least in part, a means to achieving eudaimonia.  Therefore, eudaimonia is a \"complete end\", and not a means to any other end.  The other goods, which are both ends in themselves and means for achieving eudaimonia, can be called virtues. \nAristotle investigates eudaimonia further with the \"Function Argument\".  Basically, he asserts that every thing has an inbuilt function or purpose for existence, and excellence of a thing is defined by excellence in its purpose.  For example, a television has the inbuilt purpose of entertaining its owner with television shows.  An excellent television will entertain its owner with the television shows that he wants to see, in High-Def without ever losing picture.  Things can be used for purposes other than their inbuilt purpose.  For example, I use my television as a surface on which to display empty liquor bottles.  However, it is the inbuilt function that Aristotle speaks about. \nHe asserts that just as everything else has an inbuilt function, human beings must as well.  Furthermore, he explains that the inbuilt function of a person must be related to a characteristic of humans that make them specifically human.  He writes \"we take the human function to be a certain kind of life, and take this life to be the soul's activity and actions that express reason\" (I, 7).  To Aristotle, humans are unique in that they are rational beings with a faculty for reason.  Since excellence of a thing requires the excellent performance of the function by the thing, Aristotle determines that an excellent human will reason excellently and act in accordance with excellence of reason.   The sign of a human completing his function well is that he \"expresses the proper virtue\".  So, \"the human good turns out to be the soul's activity that expresses virtue.\" \nAristotle also requires that an agent experience some good fortune in order to obtain eudaimonia.  Because eudaimonia is a constant activity, there will be both good fortune and bad fortune in the life of an agent.  The fortune relevant to eudaimonia is that which is present when you look at the big picture of the agent's life (I, 9).  So, Aristotelian eudaimonia is the highest realizable good.  It is an activity of the soul that must be performed over time, and that depends on exercising excellence in reason through virtue.  Also, eudaimonia requires sufficient good fortune of the agent that he may recognize his own well being. \n\nOn Epicureanism\n\nWe will now turn to an examination of the moral philosophy of Epicurus.  Epicureanism is also a type of eudaimonism, but is very different than that of Aristotle.  Epicurus asserts that \"pleasure is the starting-point and goal of living blessedly\" (Epicurus.  Letter to Menoecus. 128).  Epicureanism is based on empirical observation.  Cicero explains this when he writes \"as soon as each animal is born it seeks pleasure and rejoices in it as the highest good, and rejects pain as the greatest bad thing\" (Cicero.  On Goals. 1.30).  For Epicurus, successfully pursuing and maximizing pleasure is necessary in order to achieve eudaimonia.\nEpicurus does not think that pleasure alone constitutes eudaimonia.  It is also important that pain is avoided.  Many pleasures, such as \"drinking bouts and continuous partying\" and \"consuming fish and the other dainties of an extravagant table\", can have negative effects (Epicurus.  Letter to Menoecus. 129).  Epicurus does not think people should pursue pleasures that are accompanied by pain.  Instead, people should maximize their constant exposure pleasure by being virtuous.  Epicurean eudaimonia is a life of pleasure while virtue is a means to obtain it.\nThis contrasts with Aristotelian eudaimonia in the relationships between eudaimonia, virtue and reason.  To Epicurus, virtue is nothing more than a means to obtain eudaimonia.  It has no intrinsic value as an ends.  However, Aristotle holds that virtue is good as a means to obtaining eudaimonia but also good as en ends in itself.  Furthermore, Aristotle's conception of virtue relies on exercising excellence of reason, and is justified by his Function Argument.  While Epicurus uses reason to evaluate empirical observations, he does not make the same connection between virtue and reason as Aristotle.\n\n"}]}

To account for these regional differences, one can speak of the culture of a specific place (e.g. the culture of Tokyo or the culture of Kyoto) -- and yet general truths exist which can accurately describe all of those individual regional cultures as well. It is possible to continue this process of specification down to a single individual: as every person's experiences differ so does their culture, if only slightly, differ. Similarly, it is possible to continue this process in reverse via generalization. One could theoretically describe what makes \"human\" culture (though I posited that these \"humannesses\" would become much clearer with a non-human culture to which to compare it).\nMusic and language are analogous to culture in this respect. Language can be classified down to a single individual (the language of a single person is an \"idiolect\"), and musical genre can be unique down to a specific song (or perhaps even phrase).\nAnd so, now that the long explanation is out of the way, I ask: are these things actually analogous, or is there something inherent to the way that humans reason that results in this particular type of classification?\nIt is likely worth noting that I have been that Immanuel Kant discussed this very issue, but in no more detail than that.

Aristotle was obsessed with categorizing everything he observed.  Forms of argument that include premises about category, such as \"all coffee is bitter\", imply categories exist.

Aristotle noted that some individuals make good representatives of a category and others don't.  The Reliant Robin would make a poor example of the category of \"Car\" since it has three wheels and could be (and was) argued to be a motorcycle.  Useful categories include the set of individuals that are part of the category and exclude the set that are not.  The difficulty in assigning certain individuals to categories implies that categories are artificial or imposed by human reason.\nOn the other hand, Aristotle was in opposition to his teacher, Plato, on this issue.  Plato believed that individuals were shadows of true, idealized Forms.  He explained the difficulties in comparing individuals to their Form as a result of the imperfection of the material world.  Mathematical objects, such as integers and shapes, obviously have theoretical definitions that might not be exactly reproducible in the real world. (If I say I have 3 brothers that's not exactly true since each one is different than the other.  The theoretical idea of \"3\" doesn't perfectly apply.) To Plato, classifications actually exist, even though we don't observe them perfectly in the world.\nMuch of the work of philosophy in the West has tried to sort through these distinctions and their implications.

Schmitt argues that sovereignty is really the power of a government to declare a state of emergency. For background reading on his theories, look into what is probably his most famous work, The Concept of the Political.\nUsing Schmitt's terminology and conceptual background, Agamben comes out as a strong critic of modern uses of the \"state of exception\" as a justification for suspending civil liberties and other important rights. His aptly-titled book, State of Exception, argues that times of crisis have historically and currently allowed governments to increase their power over citizens well over what the law and previous legal precedent actually allows. Acting under the state of exception, in which a government is responding to a supposedly mortal threat, the state can do things that would never be justifiable in normal times, given the working principles and rule of law of that particular state. The state of exception employs justifications that work only in extremes in order to allow the state's own principles to be violated in order for it to save itself.\nAnd Agamben doesn't merely write theoretically: He writes specifically about the military order issued by United States President George W. Bush in November of 2001 (\"Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism\"), where he specifically defines the category of citizens which are subject to this order, and provides that those labeled as \"enemy combatants\", despite their status as U.S. citizens, could be detained and tried in military tribunals. It is a very specific and very close-to-home example (at least for many of us in the Western world) of how civil rights and liberties are suspended under the state of exception.\nHere's a fairly simple summary/introduction to his arguments made in State of Exception :\n\nThe state of exception is not a dictatorship (whether constitutional or unconstitutional, commissarial or sovereign) but a space devoid of law, a zone of anomie in which all legal determinations\u2014and above all the very distinction between public and private\u2014are deactivated. Thus, all those theories that seek to annex the state of exception immediately to the law are false; and so too are both the theory of necessity as the original source of law and the theory that sees the state of exception as the exercise of a state\u2019s right to its own defense or as the restoration of an originary pleromatic state of the law (\u201cfull powers\u201d). But fallacious too are those theories, like Schmitt\u2019s, that seek to inscribe the state of exception indirectly within a juridical context by grounding it in the division between norms of law and norms of the realization of law, between constituent power and constituted power, between norm and decision. The state of necessity is not a \u201cstate of law,\u201d but a space without law (even though it is not a state of nature, but presents itself in the anomie that results from the suspension of law). This space devoid of law seems, for some reason, to be so essential to the juridical order that it must seek in every way to assure itself a relation with it, as if in order to ground itself the juridical order necessarily had to maintain itself in relation with an anomie. On the one hand, the juridical void at issue in the state of exception seems absolutely unthinkable for the law; on the other, this unthinkable thing nevertheless has a decisive strategic relevance for the juridical order and must not be allowed to slip away at any cost. The crucial problem connected to the suspension of the law is that of the acts committed during the institium, the nature of which seems to escape all legal definition. Because they are neither transgressive, executive, nor legislative, they seem to be situated in an absolute non-place with respect to the law. The idea of a force-of-law is a response to this undefinability and this non-place. It is as if the suspension of law freed a force or a mystical element, a sort of legal mana (the expression is used by Wagenvoort to describe the Roman auctoritas [Wagenvoort 1947, 106]), that both the ruling power and its adversaries, the constituted power as well as the constituent power, seek to appropriate. Force of law that is separate from the law, floating imperium, being-in-force [vigenza] without application, and, more generally, the idea of a sort of \u201cdegree zero\u201d of the law\u2014all these are fictions through which law attempts to encompass its own absence and to appropriate the state of exception, or at least to assure itself a relation with it.\n\u2013 Agamben, Giorgio. State of Exception (2005). p. 61\n\nIf you're interested in this sort of theory, State of Exception is a thoroughly worthwhile read. If you have no prior exposure to Agamben's concept of homo sacer or the theory of \"bare life\", you may feel a bit lost, as he starts criticizing the state of exception in terms of its ability to deprive people of citizenship and divide the body into two poles\u2014bios and zoe. For conceptual background on this, you'd need to read through his earlier book, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life.\n"}]}

Even so, might certain religious beliefs be true?\"\nObviously, the answer to that is \"yes\", since there are many things that are true but which we lack justified, true belief.  For instance, someone will win a lottery in the near future despite many people believing they will win and none of them being justified.  Further there are people who have convinced themselves that they do have justification because they've developed a system or received the numbers in a dream or whatever.  At some point, one of those people might win the lottery and turn out to have true belief justified by whatever evidence they suppose they have.2\nBut you also ask whether religious knowledge can be persuasive based on religious experiences, which is a separate and trickier question.  In the lottery case, few people would accept that some knowledge of future lottery results is justified.  Even if someone really was justified in believing they knew future lottery numbers (by bribing the person who picks the numbers to somehow manipulate the results or inventing time travel), consider the difficulty involved in persuading someone else they have such knowledge.  Only the most gullible would believe such a claim.3  There are just too many cases where something too good to be true is for most of us to take such extraordinary claims at face value no matter what the evidence.\nHowever, I wonder if your assumption that recent research has shown religious experiences to be unreliable holds.  Polling data shows that, at least in the US, equal numbers of people report having \"Religious and Mystical Experiences\" and not having them.  Global polls would likely show that most people have had those sorts of experiences.  And history suggests that these sorts of experiences are overwhelmingly normal for humans.  Extrapolating a bit, they seem least common among populations that have taken an a priori position against the possibility of such experiences.  Confirmation bias would suggest that in those populations, evidence for such experiences is ignored and evidence against is highlighted.\nNow it's certainly possible that more enlightened populations are justified in dismissing religious experiences, but starting with the position that they are not reliable evidence would be a form of begging the question.\n\nAs a Christian, I'm compelled to point out that Jesus didn't seem particularly concerned about convincing people that his claims were true.  In fact, he was purposely vague on some points:\n\nAnd [Jesus] said to them, \u201cTo you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables, so that\n\u201cthey may indeed see but not perceive,\n    and may indeed hear but not understand,\n lest they should turn and be forgiven.\u201d\n\n\u2014Mark 4:11-12 (ESV)\n\nThis is a very difficult passage for me, and I'd imagine for many believers.  It seems that God gives some people the ability to recognize him and does not give \"the secret of the kingdom of God\" to others.  It seems that God may be hidden in plain sight.  Make of that what you will.\n\nFootnotes:\n\nUnintentionally ironic.\n\nThis is a restatement of the Gettier problem, if I understand correctly.  The main thrust is that a person may have justified, true belief, but not really know something.  That does not seem relevant to your question, since you don't actually seem to promote the JTB formula.\n\nI'm reminded of the BBC special in which a woman was convinced that the host (Derren Brown) had a fool-proof system for selecting horses.  It turns out the woman was the victim of survivorship bias and that the \"System\" was a hoax.  What strikes me as interesting about the show is that there are people who have the ability to successfully gamble on horse races, but it would be harder to convince skeptics of the ability since it's nowhere near perfect.  Rather, the ability has more to do with expert risk management than some mystical ability to know which horses will win.\n\n\n"}]}

The Wikipedia article defines solipsism as \"the epistemological or ontological position that knowledge of anything outside one's own specific mind is unjustified\".\nThe IEP article, Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds, adequately summarizes the cases for and against solipsism.  The article makes reference to relevant works by philosophers including Descartes, Locke, Wittgenstein, Ayer, Quine, Mill and others.  The passage from the article which is most relevant to your specific question is entitled The Incoherence of Solipsism and has been copied below:\n\nWith the belief in the essential privacy of experience eliminated as false, the last presupposition underlying solipsism is removed and solipsism is shown as foundationless, in theory and in fact. One might even say, solipsism is necessarily foundationless, for to make an appeal to logical rules or empirical evidence the solipsist would implicitly have to affirm the very thing that he purportedly refuses to believe: the reality of intersubjectively valid criteria and a public, extra-mental world. There is a temptation to say that solipsism is a false philosophical theory, but this is not quite strong or accurate enough. As a theory, it is incoherent. What makes it incoherent, above all else, is that the solipsist requires a language (that is a sign-system) to think or to affirm his solipsistic thoughts at all. Given this, it is scarcely surprising that those philosophers who accept the Cartesian premises that make solipsism apparently plausible, if not inescapable, have also invariably assumed that language-usage is itself essentially private. The cluster of arguments \u2013 generally referred to as \u201cthe private language argument\u201d \u2013 that we find in the Investigations against this assumption effectively administers the coup de gr\u00e2ce to both Cartesian dualism and solipsism. (I. \u00a7 202; 242-315). Language is an irreducibly public form of life that is encountered in specifically social contexts. Each natural language-system contains an indefinitely large number of \u201clanguage-games,\u201d governed by rules that, though conventional, are not arbitrary personal fiats. The meaning of a word is its (publicly accessible) use in a language. To question, argue, or doubt is to utilize language in a particular way. It is to play a particular kind of public language-game. The proposition \u201cI am the only mind that exists\u201d makes sense only to the extent that it is expressed in a public language, and the existence of such language itself implies the existence of a social context. Such a context exists for the hypothetical last survivor of a nuclear holocaust, but not for the solipsist. A non-linguistic solipsism is unthinkable and a thinkable solipsism is necessarily linguistic. Solipsism therefore presupposes the very thing that it seeks to deny. That solipsistic thoughts are thinkable in the first instance implies the existence of the public, shared, intersubjective world that they purport to call into question.\n\nIntersubjectivity\nThe analysis and arguments from IEP summarize the approach to the issue in analytic philosophy.  [Continental philosophy], specifically phenomenology, addresses this skepticism by introducing the concept of intersubjectivity.  Intersubjectivity is based on a phenomenlogical ontology, which \"is the study of structures of consciousness as experienced from the first-person point of view\".  The phenomenological equivalent to \"I think, therefore, I am\" is \"I apprehend myself as a subject of consciousness\" (by contrast to an object).  Intersubjectivity is basically the apprehension of an Other as a subject (like the self), and its existence is the refutation of solipsism.  This refutation requires the acceptance of a phenomenological paradigm.\nExistentialism (based on phenomenlogical ontology) has sometimes been accused of espousing solipsism.  However, Sartre argues that existentialism and solipsism are necessarily incompatible.  The most concise and easily digestible instance of this argument can be found in the text of his 1964 talk, Existentialism Is A Humanism.\nIn an effort to \"to offer a defence of existentialism against several reproaches that have been laid against it\", Sartre describes a common mistake about existentialism as: \n\nBoth from this side and from the other we are also reproached for leaving out of account the solidarity of mankind and considering man in isolation. And this, say the Communists, is because we base our doctrine upon pure subjectivity \u2013 upon the Cartesian \u201cI think\u201d: which is the moment in which solitary man attains to himself; a position from which it is impossible to regain solidarity with other men who exist outside of the self. The ego cannot reach them through the cogito.\n\nIn Summary,\nThere has been quite a bit of work done \"that actively sought to rationalize that anybody else exists\".  However, there haven't been any notable proponents of solipsism, (most likely because such a view contradicts our common sense).\n"}]}

For objects of the senses, to say that something exists means not that it has an additional property that is part of its concept but rather that it is to be found outside of thought and that we have an empirical perception of it in space and time. A really existing thing does not have any properties that could be predicated of it that differentiate it from the concept of that thing. What differentiates it is that we actually experience it: for example, it has shape, a specifiable location, and duration. To give an example of Kant's point: the reason we say that horses exist and unicorns do not is not that the concept of horse has the property of existence and the concept of unicorn does not, or that the concept of horse has more of that property than the concept of unicorn. There is no difference between the two concepts in this regard. And there is no difference between the concept of a horse and the concept of a really existing horse: the concepts are identical. The reason we say that horses exist is simply that we have spatio-temporal experience of them: there are objects corresponding to the concept. So any demonstration of the existence of anything, including God, that relies on predicating a property (in this case existence) of that thing is fallacious. (wikipedia)\n\n"}]}

Imagine two ants walking between two given points (close enough there is an obvious shortest route) on a soccer ball, one on the outside, the other trapped inside- at each point 'outside ant's' right is 'inside ant's' left and vice versa. (incidentally, this gives a nice way of thinking about non-orientable surfaces as surfaces having only one side)\nNow you'll notice that, as you were visualising the inside and outside ants walking between two points, you were able (perhaps with some difficulty) to identify what they would call left and right. This is because for each ant I implicitly gave you a definition of what forwards was, and what up was- and you could have used the superficially satisfying definition:\n\nRight is a quarter turn clockwise from forward, when viewed from above\n\nNow this is only superficially satifying, as it rather leaves one wondering about how one defines 'clockwise'. In fact the two are tied up together- defining one will automatically give one a definition of the other, and sadly each is to all extents mathematically arbitrary (barring the aspect in which our mathematics emulates our physical world cf. the end of JDH's answer).\nYou see, the inside/outside correspondence I put forward toward the start of this answer secretly depends on the ants in question already having a left and right of their own that they bring to the table, so to speak. \nWhere this comes from, then, is perhaps therefore the body and brain of the ant (or human!), in which the somatic, sensory and motor functions of each side of the body are lateralized to the opposite side of the brain (that is, for example, the left visual hemisphere is represented in the right visual cortex), so the brain already knows its left from its right preverbally, and from there it's just a matter of association with sounds and shapes to 'learn' left and right as we do.\n"}]}

We can distinguish up and down sensorially by inner ear changes and proprioception (sense of contraction of particular muscles). It is easier to let the head drop down over the chest than it is to pick it back up; these sensations correspond to the sense of up and down (in space, one doesn't have that sensation, and one has difficulty assigning up and down that way.\nAs to left and right, one has visual sensors that are on one side and on the the other and those correspond (however one assigns them) to what one can call left or right (anatomically, when we look at the eye, we see that the part of the eye that corresponds to sensing what we call the left of the visual field happens to be on the right side of the eye, but that switch doesn't matter, we can still label what we see (not what we see with) by left or right consistently.

But it is conceivable that a right-handed space traveler, having followed a certain path, would return as left-handed, while still insisting that he or she is right-handed. In such a universe, there would seem to be no fact of the matter about left and right.\n\nSuppose we accept that there would be no fact of the matter about left and right in such a universe.  This alone would, however, not make the traveler\u2019s insistence nonsensical.  To him, his right hand remains the right one in spite of any orientation swapping.  (Of course we don\u2019t have to call it the \u2018right\u2019 hand.)\nI believe the question of how a human subject knows the right hand from the left is assimilable to how he knows the right hand from the right foot, or the nose.  Again, we can strip the questions of \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018left\u2019 and also of \u2018hand\u2019 and \u2018foot.\u2019  We can also strip them of epistemology by asking what it is for a sensation in the right hand to be in the right hand.  Or if we are allowed the terminology \u2018tactile location\u2019 we are asking what individuates tactile locations.\nWe may ask the same question of \u2018visual location.\u2019  When I open my eye I am confronted with what looks like a surface.  I can divide it into left, center and right regions, or upper, center and lower ones.  I believe I could do this even if I were floating in space without any gravitational pull and didn\u2019t have the benefit of my right hand often appearing in the right region or my hair often falling in from the upper.  Of course I may not have the \u2018right and left\u2019 and \u2018upper and lower\u2019 vocabulary.  Again we are speaking of individuation of visual locations.\nI don\u2019t think there is any necessity about the correlation between visual and tactile locations.  In each of these, I think something fundamental is going on.  That is to say, I don\u2019t think one \u2018learns\u2019 that a pain is in one\u2019s right foot and not elsewhere.  \u2018At first I only knew there was some pain, but didn\u2019t know where.  But by and by, I came to learn to locate them.  I had to hire a teacher and practice it on my free time.\u2019  This is not our experience; I don\u2019t even know it makes sense to speak of \u2018knowing\u2019 or \u2018not knowing\u2019 there.  In the same way, I don\u2019t think we \u2018learn\u2019 that a thing is in the center of our visual field, or to the left, or to the right.\nOf course, our visual and tactile locations happen to correlate.  My right hand often appears to the right of my visual field.  Or the sight of a dog biting the hand \u2018over here\u2019 in my visual field often (all right, always) correlates to my having pain \u2018over here\u2019 in my tactile field.\nSuppose then I hold an apple in my left hand and see it in the corner of my left eye.  The apple is \u2018to my left in space\u2019 as it were.  This location in space would bear a certain relation to the \u2018left\u2019 region in my visual field as well as the \u2018left\u2019 region of my tactile field.  We may say any number of things about this relation (not all of them right).  E.g. the left region in space, existing independently, is sensed, tracked etc. by sensory events in me; is a \u2018construct\u2019 of my sensory locations; is mere shorthand for saying what happened in my sensory fields; etc.\nAccording to this view, the concept of spatial left and right to a human subject would in some way or other derive from the locations in his sensory fields.  The individuation of locations in a particular sensory field would be fundamental, meaning not the sort of thing one learns.\nI believe that the visual experience may lead the way (as it were) in the assignment of location.  That is to say, while my nose, neck, left and right arms and hands, the groins, the two legs and feet, the twenty digits, while all these are distinct without my having to learn the distinction, I don\u2019t know that they stack neatly one way or other.  For example, could I have known that my thumb is farthest away from the pinky without seeing the five fingers?\nI don\u2019t intend to tell a physiological or developmental story.  I believe there would be a way to strip the thing above of all that stuff so that we are left with a thin analytical statement about the reducibility of spatial location to individuation of location in sensory fields, which is not a thing to be learned.\nSuch location would survive any orientation swapping as is imagined in the other answer because we are talking about two different things.  I want to add that I am not sure about this, but only propose it as a possibility.  I certainly have not argued for it.  Thanks.\n"}]}

It is also one of a number of different (sometimes conflicting) considerations that go into the determination of the burden of proof. I said 'heuristic' as there is no algorithmic way to determine where the burden of proof lies.\nImagine that we observed some phenomenon for which cannot account, say the diminished bee populations. Were I to suggest that the population decline was caused by cell phone transmissions, you might well accept that this is the sort of thing which could conceivably be involved but might still reasonably demand to know why I think this. 'Well, why do you think it isn't cell phone transmissions?' would be a wholly inappropriate reply on my part. As I am offering the positive account, all else being equal, the burden is on me to establish that my account is correct, not upon you to impeach it. \nAnother consideration is initial plausibility. Say that we were to arrive at my apartment and observe that the door frame was splintered, the door was open, all my electronics and other portable valuables were gone. You offer the theory that I have been robbed; I offer the theory that a highly localized meteorological phenomenon tore through my apartment. We both are offering affirmative claims, but since yours is quite plausible and mine is not at all plausible, the burden is on me rather than on you. Indeed, we would reasonably take the inability of proponents to mount a serious case for alternative explanations to count as a reason to accept your account.\nNeither of these are fool-proof. One can often reformulate a claim to change whether it seems affirmative or negative (often with a transformation that seems less like a cheap trick than the one your offer). And, erroneous beliefs will  adversely affect the extent to which our judgments of plausibility are reliable. (It takes a fair bit of knowledge of 20th c. science to find it plausible that the chair on which I sit is made mainly of empty space.)\nSome conflict between these two considerations can help explain why \"all else being equal\" is needed. If you have the view that dogs exist and I've the view that they do not, the fact that your claim is affirmative hardly means that the burden of proof is on you; my claim is so implausible that that implausibility swamps the affirmative nature of your claim for purposes of finding where the burden of proof lies. \nA third consideration is the costs of error on each side. Consider two drugs developed by pharmaceutical firms, one intended to help with acne, the other to help patients with advance terminal cancer. The burden of proof to establish safety of the drugs is higher on the firm that developed the acne medication than it is on the firm with the drug targeting the cancer patient as the cost of error in the acne case is much higher.\n"}]}

You can not from a set of facts (which are all about the past or present) induce anything about the future (which is what the explanatory theories do).\nKarl Poppers famous solution to this is \"falsification\", i e that theories does not need to be proven, they need to be falsified.  Therefore the burden of proof in these cases rest on the person who claims they are false. This concerns things like:\n\nCapitalism causes poverty\nThe diversity of life is an effect of speciation by evolution\nMountain ranges are created when continents crash together very slowly\nThe earth is flat, it just looks round because of optical illusions\nIt is impossible to go faster than the speed of light\n\netc.\nThe proving here can be either to show that the facts or assumptions in the theory is wrong, or that the logic doesn't work, or most commonly, by coming up with a better theory. \"Better\" generally means either more accurate or simpler, with less assumptions (like Ockhams razor).\nThe original posts \"there exists at least one universe where A does not exist\" is a claim of existence, so in that case, you have to prove that this universe exists. However, it is not as you say a claim of non-existence, because it allows A to exist in other universes. Therefore it is not a reformulation of the negative claim. The negative claim is either \"There exists NO universe where A exists\", or just \"A does not exist in this universe\". Both interpretations of \"A does not exist\" are reasonable and in practice equal, as we can't know anything about other universes.\n"}]}

It's fairly easy to imagine how any positive claim could be rephrased so as to be a negative one, and it's difficult to imagine that this should reasonably remove the asserter's burden of proof.\nNow, the problem lies in the fact that it's often thought to be extremely difficult, if not actually impossible, to prove a negative. It's easy to imagine (in theory) how one would go about proving a positive statement, but things become much more difficult when your task is to prove the absence of something.\nBut many philosophers and logicians actually disagree with the catchphrase \"you can't prove a negative\". Steven Hales argues that this is merely a principle of \"folk logic\", and that a fundamental law of logic, the law of non-contradiction, makes it relatively straightforward to prove a negative.\nIn practice, I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Hales seems to be making the argument that it's possible to assemble a formal logical proof of a negative statement. He doesn't guarantee the possibility of conclusively proving all of the premises of such argument. That is all well and good, but the average person rarely finds formal logic proofs very persuasive. The real problem is that negative claims often make assertions about things that we are in practice either unable to observe altogether, or that are difficult to observe in finite time.\nConsider, for example, I make the claim that \"there is no intelligent life on other planets\". Certainly it seems intuitive that I possess the burden of proof for such a statement. But as discussed, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for me to actually provide a compelling proof of this claim, because it's impossible to conclusively examine the entire contents of this and every other universe, looking for intelligent life (even putting aside such technical issues as what barometer we use to measure \"intelligence\", or even \"life\"). \nCertainly, following Hales's example, I could make the following \"logical\" argument:\n\nPremise A: If intelligent life were to exist elsewhere in our, or any other, universe, we would be able to make contact with it.  \nPremise B: We have been unable to make contact with any intelligent life in our, or any other, universe.\nConclusion: Therefore, intelligent life does not exist in our, or any other, universe.\n\nBut I guarantee that anyone reading that argument is immediately going to object to the first premise. Some would probably even quibble over the second. In a strictly logical sense, my argument is sound: if the premises hold, then the conclusion follows. But that doesn't mean it will manage to convince very many people. The reality is that because negatively-phrased statements often make such sweeping claims, it's very easy to conceive of potential counter-examples or poke holes in the premises of those proofs.\n\nBut I don't think it's accurate to say that the burden of proof falls only on those who claim non-existence, either. Consider that I were to make the argument that Santa Claus exists. Why should the burden of proof be on you to disprove that argument? Certainly in making a claim, I should possess at least a minimal burden of proof to substantiate that claim, right?\nSo my general rule, and one widely followed in philosophical debates, is that the person who is making a claim always holds the initial burden of proof. Once that claim is made and the burden of proof is overcome, the burden of proof falls to any challengers of that argument, because what is a challenge to an argument but a claim to the contrary? \nThe way I see it, it's logically disingenuous to allow people to get away with making any type of argument without providing some sort of proof for that claim. For what it's worth, I've never heard the premise that you lead with in your question, and it strikes me as downright specious. A person who claims that \"God exists\" should have just as much burden of proving that assertion as a person who claims that \"God does not exist\". Why should I be free to spout nonsense just because I rephrase it as a negative?\n"}]}

However a statement of \"Many people prefer the taste of BBQ sauce to A1 on their burgers\" may fall in a grey area.  It is a statement of opinion but it has a indefinate amount of quantification.

One side will assert the proposition and assume the burden of proof while the other side will refute the proposition.  But the structure of the proposition may be anything the two sides can agree to debate.  Using your example, the proposition could be that God exists or that he doesn't.  Whichever side takes up the affirmative side assumes the burden of proof.\nIn practice, it's often useful for the proposition to be one that asserts the existence of God, since a person making that assertion has specific properties and definitions of the concept in mind.  Meanwhile, the person rejecting the assertion presumably isn't in a position to propose a definition of God.  A similar situation occurs in court trials: the prosecution takes on the burden of proof because it would be impractical for the defense to show the defendant is innocent of all possible crimes.  (There are other, very good, reasons for this procedure in addition when it comes to the legal system.) \nNotice that while the burden of proof is a powerful advantage in a debate, it isn't decisive.  The affirmative position has control over the definition of terms, which is critically important.  Suppose, for instance, that Sir Issac Newton were in a debate over his Second Law of motion:\nF = ma\n\nIf his opponent pointed out that we observe centrifugal force if we rotate a body around an axis.  For instance, a bucket full of water will not spill even if it's upside down, but there is no acceleration a opposing the gravitational acceleration.\nSince Newton has taken the affirmative side, he is free to argue that a represents both linear and angular acceleration.  Usually when we think of acceleration, we mean linear acceleration like what happens when a body is free to fall to Earth or when a body is pushed across a surface.  It might seem like Newton is changing the meaning of words, but that's one of the rights of the person making a claim.  \nHere we touch on Karl Popper's falsification criteria for scientific inquiry (as introduced in Lennart Regebro's answer).  Traditionally, science was seen as an application of inductive reasoning.  However as David Hume (and others) have pointed out, it isn't possible to show that inductive reasoning is valid without relying on inductive reasoning itself, which begs the question.  Popper's solution was to suggest that we should not attempt to pursue inductive solutions to scientific questions, but to propose solutions that are most likely wrong (often because they make very specific predictions) and try to find evidence they are wrong.  According to Popper, falsification rather than induction is the goal of science.  For this reason, rather than the practical reasons I suggest above, the burden of proof is on the person making  positive claim such as \"Newton's Second Law holds always and everywhere.\"\nThomas Kuhn responds directly to Popper in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions: \n\nClearly, the role thus attributed to falsification is much like the one this essay assigns to anomalous experiences, i.e., to experiences that, by evoking crisis, prepare the way for a new theory.  Nevertheless, anomalous experiences may not be identified with falsifying ones.  Indeed, I doubt that the later exist.  As has repeatedly been emphasized before, no theory ever solves all the puzzles with which it is confronted at a given time; nor are the solutions already achieved often perfect.  On the contrary, it is just the incompleteness and imperfection of the existing data-theory fit that, at any given time, define many of the puzzles that characterize normal science. If any and every failure to fit were ground for theory rejection, all theories ought to be rejected at all times.\n\nIn summary, there's no reason to say that the \"negative\" side of an argument does not have a burden of proof, but in practice propositions are usually formulated in a \"positive\" mode in order to narrow the scope of a debate.  But other times a negative proposition may be necessary.  For instance, in a parole hearing the burden of proof is reversed from the trial rules: it's necessary to prove to some level of burden that the prisoner will not violate their parole if released.  In a philosophical debate, it's likely the burden of proof would fall on the person claiming that the material world does not exist, but is an illusion.  \n"}]}

Hence, there are no needs for the props of traditional religion. With dogma and creed excluded, then immutable truth is also dead and buried. There is no room for fixed, natural law or moral absolutes.\" Humanists believe one should do, as one feels is right. \n\nIs there any evidence to the contrary? \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, humanism does not, in any way, necessitate relativism. They are completely different philosophies. In fact, I'm not sure that I can even imagine a way in which humanism would imply relativism.\nOne thing to get straight at the outset is a definition of \"humanism\". There are at least two major ideologies that typically fall under the umbrella of humanism. First is secular humanism, which is probably the one you're thinking of when you talk about \"humanism\". Secular humanism tends to justify action in terms of human reason, ethics, and justice. And in doing so, it naturally denounces religious dogma, superstition, and other things that could be considered \"pseudo-science\". However, it does not prescribe a particular code or system of ethics, and many philosophers who fall into the \"humanist\" camp have strongly believed in universal moral standards, exactly the opposite of relativism. A few examples of such thinkers might be: Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, and John Rawls. Certainly, secular humanism can be seen as incompatible with a strong religious faith, on which basis you may take objection to it, but it certainly is not incompatible with objectivism (with a little O), the idea that there is a universal system of ethics accessible to all.\nAnother common branch of humanism is religious humanism, which actually attempts to integrate humanism with religious ideals. Religious humanism is fairly straight-forward: it places the focus on the human being, affirming the individual dignity and worth of all people, just like the name na\u00efvely implies. Certainly this could be compatible with religious teachings. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard is a famous \"Christian Existential Humanist\".\nBeyond these two specific disciplines, you'll also see \"humanism\" applied generically to any philosophy that places the primary focus on human beings, as opposed to society at large or organized religion. But again, the idea that different cultures have different ideas about morality and ethical principles, and that those ideals are equally as valid as any other culture's ideals, is not implied by this line of thinking. Neither is the relativist tenant that there is no absolute truth or validity. In fact, a humanist could argue that human intuition, reason, and moral virtue are themselves absolute truths!\n\nBut beyond that, it appears that your confusion (and the confusion of whomever wrote the article you are quoting) stems mainly from the notion that atheism (or the rejection of organized religion) implies relativism, absent or beyond its humanist affiliations. That is also quite incorrect (albeit quite a common fallacy that religious scholars succumb to). \nThe flaw lies in thinking that the only possible source for an objective morality is from [a] God. While that's certainly one possible source, and even a good source, it's far from the only possible source. Humanists, as I hinted above, would argue that human rationality, intuition, and logic are the sources for morality, and since all humans share these faculties, such a moral framework would be objectively shared across all humanity.\nThere is an entire world of philosophers who don't necessarily believe in the existence of a supreme being, yet believe in objective morality. The one who makes this position most persuasively is probably Shelly Kagan, a contemporary moral philosopher. And other philosophers have even argued (this is Plato's famous Euthyphro dilemma) that objective morality cannot be based on God, even if both are granted to exist.\n"}]}

In a question first raised by Plato in the Euthyphro, one can still inquire which way the conceptual priority runs:\n\nGod's approving of X is what makes X be right, or\nX is right, God recognizes that, and approves of X for that reason.\n\nIf one adopts the first alternative, then God's approvals and disapprovals are constitutive of right and wrong. On the second, there are (somehow) facts about right and wrong that are not conceptually dependent upon God's commands and approvals.  \nThe first alternation is the Divine Command Theory of morality. It is, within the Christian tradition at least, a decidedly minority view. It has several serious problems:\n\nIt makes right and wrong arbitrary. On the view, God's approvals are not tracking some independent good. Thus, God literally had no reason for approving of this or that; it is just what He happened to approve of. Had God approved of the torture of infants, then infant torture would be right. (An adherent of the Divine Command Theory cannot consistently say \"But God wouldn't approve of such a horrible thing!\" as that invites the question as to how or why it is horrible conceptually prior to the divine approvals.)\nIt makes right and wrong hostage to God's change of mind. Were God to begin to feel differently, different things would become right and wrong. (Admittedly, on many religious accounts, God is eternal and unchanging, so this would not arise.)\nIt makes it impossible to say \"God is good\" in a meaningful way. If God's approvals constitute the good, unsurprisingly, God scores well on the question of goodness; it could not be other, provided that God is minimally coherent.\nIt gives the wrong sorts of reasons for actions being right and wrong. Let us assume that God does disapprove of the torture of infants. Well and good. But, presumably the reasons that the torture of infants is wrong include the pain and suffering it causes and the gross violation of human dignity that it involves. I surely would expect a genuinely good deity to disapprove of it; anyone who shares that very expectation reveals that they think of infant torture as genuinely wrong and of God's disapproval of such torture as reflective of a truth of its moral status rather than as constitutive of such a truth.\n\nSo, on any religious view (such as most denominations of Christianity and some schools of thought in Islam) that rejects the Divine Command Theory, there needs to be some alternative account of what makes the good good. The Natural Law tradition is one such attempt, though both as it still gives God an important role and because of various serious objections, it is not widely accepted outside of Roman Catholicism and is not a serious option for the Humanist.\nAll is not lost, however. Both Utilitarianism and Kantian ethics attempt to provide non-theistic means to ground a notion of good. Utilitarianism proceeds by observing that we do value pleasure and the absence of pain, argues that these are the ultimate ends for which we act, and then argues that the extent to which actions meant the ultimate ends for which we act and which we do value as good is the rational basis for a test of the goodness of actions. Kantian ethics attempts to ground a conception of the good action in terms of rational conduct, arguing that to act on a rule that could not consistently be wished to be a universally accepted rule is to act incoherently and thus wrongly. Both Kantianism and Utilitarianism can be developed in ways consistent with a religious faith and in ways consistent with atheism. There are of course other candidate accounts of morality, too. \nSo, there is no necessary path from \"There is no God\" to \"Everything is permitted.\" Yes, the questions as to what is right and wrong absent God are hard. But they are exactly as hard as the real question as to why the right is right that the religious person faces unless they adopt the unsatisfactory Divine Command Theory of morality. \n"}]}

I have included descriptions of these views and links to places to start below:\n\nPaternalism\nPaternalism is the interference of a state or an individual with another person, against their will, and defended or motivated by a claim that the person interfered with will be better off or protected from harm. The issue of paternalism arises with respect to restrictions by the law such as anti-drug legislation, the compulsory wearing of seatbelts, and in medical contexts by the withholding of relevant information concerning a patient's condition by physicians. At the theoretical level it raises questions of how persons should be treated when they are less than fully rational.\n\n\nPaternalism, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n\n\nConsequentialist Libertarianism\nJohn Stuart Mill's 1859, On Liberty made the case that \"over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign\".  Here is a helpful excerpt from the Wikipedia page:\nPerhaps the most memorable point made by Mill in this work, and his basis for liberty, is that \"over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign\". Mill is compelled to make this assertion in opposition to what he calls the \"tyranny of the majority\", wherein through control of etiquette and morality, society is an unelected power that can do horrific things. Mill's work could be considered a reaction to this social control by the majority and his advocacy of individual decision-making over the self. The famous Harm Principle, or the principle of liberty, is also articulated in this work: the state of any other social body has no right to coerce or restrict the individual unless the individual causes harm to others, crucially, the individual's own physical or moral harm is not justification for constriction of their liberty. All branches of liberalism\u2014as well as other political ideologies\u2014consider this to be one of their core principles. However, they often disagree on what exactly constitutes harm.\n\n\nSocial and Political Philosophy of John Stuart Mill\nLibertarianism, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n\n"}]}

So it's possible it would play out differently.\nObesity is a long-term condition, a cumulative effect of things that happen over some period of time. Preventing obesity might involve forbidding or mandating certain moment-to-moment choices (banning chocolate, requiring exercise to use public services) but those things are not themselves the goal. It's theoretically possible to end obesity without eradicating any of the behaviors that promote it.\nOn the other hand, anti-drug goals are often, if not always, stated in terms of ending drug use (the moment-to-moment choice) rather than drug addiction or other long-term drug conditions. See William Bennett's statement here or a US official boasting about cocaine shortages.\n(Note that long-term harms from the use of certain drugs are often cited as a motivation for banning drug use, but that is not the same as using them to characterize what a program's simple intent is.)\nFor an anti-obesity program to be futile for the reasons the \"War On Drugs\" is, it would need to be framed as a \"war on dessert\" and use an all-or-nothing framing under which each time any person eats a donut is a mark against the program, with long-term obesity rates being at best a second-order indicator of success.\nI agree that a \"war on smoking\" would most likely take a form parallel to the War On Drugs, i.e. an attempt to ban and interdict cigarettes, and would likely be framed such that the inevitable market in contraband cigarettes would be treated as the failure of the program, and so would be no more successful than the War On Drugs.\nThis whole answer is based on speculation about how a \"war on obesity\" or \"war on smoking\", so named, would likely be handled by the US government as it contingently exists; I am not claiming any abstract distinctions between the various realms of human behavior that these different \"wars\" would seek to affect.\n"}]}

Perhaps transhumanism will serve: man remaining man, but trans\u00adcending himself, by realizing new possibilities of and for his human nature.\n\n\"Post-Human\" was coined no later than 1988.  Here's Robert Pepperell's definition:\n\n2.12. First we had God, Humans and Nature. The Rationalists dispensed with God leaving Humans in perpetual conflict with Nature. The Post_Humanists dispense with Humans leaving only Nature. The distinction between God, Nature and Humanity does not represent any eternal truth about the human condition. It merely reflects the prejudices of the societies which maintained the distinction.\n\nSo the general idea of humanity pulling itself to some transcended state seems to be a common thread, but whether the result is still human seems to be at issue.  If I've got the order of coinage correct, all posthumanists owe their philosophical heritage to transhumanism, but not the other way around.  \n"}]}

In this case, Matt and I were talking about entrance requirements into college and the practice of \"reverse discrimination\" and affirmative action.\nMuch of the discourse on affirmative action has taken place in the US court system. The 1978 CA v. Bakke case encouraged the benefits of diversity in the classroom (akin to a modern John Stuart Mill dream). Many speak of a certain \"critical mass.\" A lot more attention was given recently in the Grutter v. Bollinger case, when the US Supreme Court dissent (I refer directly to Chief Justice Rehnquist's dissent) spoke of the inadequate progress towards achieving critical mass and the unconstitutionality of such action. In 2006, Michigan voted for the so-called Proposal 2, eliminating some forms of affirmative action. But last week, a federal court struck this down. I wonder if there is a lot being written about the negative effects of affirmative action outside of news, courtrooms, and sensationalist periodicals.\nThere are many arguments for or against affirmative action, and I want to emphasize that I am not debating affirmative action in this question. Matt and I were wondering whether or not there are any contemporary philosophers that have written about the potential negative effects of reverse discrimination already.\nFor more references on the path of affirmative action, I recommend reading the initial executive order starting it within the States and this timeline.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, those philosophers exist. But they're not nearly as trendy as you might have imagined. The philosophical arguments made against affirmative action now are exactly the same ones that were made by theorists long before race-conscious theories ever existed. It's the writings of anyone who ever encouraged blind justice and universal social equality, from strict deontologists like Immanuel Kant to liberal political philosophers like John Rawls.\nOne could do worse than to start by thinking through Rawls's Veil of Ignorance, wherein one imagines that she is forced to decide the fate and organization of her future society without knowing the specific role in that society which she will be assigned to play. In other words, no one knows their place in society, their class position, their social status, or their assets and abilities ahead of time. They might be placed into the society as a poor black female, a rich white male, or anything in between. The idea is that one would choose the most just society for all members, rather than be tainted by a bias for one's own current social group. This is nothing particularly revolutionary, considering that liberal theorists since the Enlightenment have argued in favor of universal equality, justice as fairness to all, and the equal (re-)distribution of wealth.\nIn fact, it is the notion of \"affirmative action\" that is relatively new, and not just because philosophers have stereotypically been rich white men that didn't care about the oppressed minority groups. Philosophically and legally, the affirmative action system has its roots in critical legal studies (CLS), and more specifically, the branch of CLS that deals with race\u2014critical race theory (CRT). The primary authors here are probably Derrick Bell and Richard Delgado, and I think Mari Matsuda deserves specific mention as a particularly lucid and readable theorist in this tradition. Her book (with Charles Lawrence), We Won't Go Back: Making the Case for Affirmative Action, is probably one of the landmark texts tying CRT with affirmative action.\nCritical race theory has two primary objectives. First is a critical genealogy of the way in which power struggles across racial boundaries have been borne out over time, and more specifically, the role that the law and legal system have played in that process. Second is a sustained effort to transform the current system (both legally and socially) into one that is capable of true racial emancipation and a sustainable ability to resist entrenched oppressive hierarchies. The Wikipedia article is a fine introduction to the other themes at work in CRT (see the section entitled \"Key theoretical elements), but the real landmark of CRT, the pivotal point of disagreement between it and traditional liberalism as discussed above, is the rejection of color-blindness. In summary, CRT is a race-conscious theory that looks specifically at the dynamics of racial power and their effects on the law, rather than pretending that law is racially-neutral as liberalism has done for years. CRT theorists have argued that abstract, rights-based remedies don't work, as they fail to change the oppressive hierarchies of subordination and dominance that have been for so long entrenched into the legal system. As hard as we pretend that the system is color-blind, the results indicate clearly that it is not. (There's a lot of other critical theory hoopla mixed in, of course, like intersectionality, strategic essentialism, and a strong emphasis on personal narratives, but none of this is particularly germane to the issue that is addressed in the question.)\nEssentially, though, it all boils down to how one feels that equality should be measured. There are two primary camps here. The first argues that equality should be assessed in terms of one's opportunities; this is commonly referred to as the equality of opportunity. The argument here is that everyone should be equally capable of achieving the same ends, that there should be no systemic barriers (social, legal, cultural, economic, or otherwise) that stand in the way of the success of any individual or group. The other primary theory of equality is commonly referred to as the equality of outcomes (or results), in which the argument is made that true equality is only achieved when everyone in the society ends up in truly equal positions after all the decisions have been made and everything has shaken out. This gives prejudices and discrimination a chance to rear their ugly head, intervening in what appeared on the surface to be a completely fair and equitable system. Which type of equality that you consider most important to maximize generally determines which types of social programs you favor.\n"}]}

Or anything in this vein, for that matter?\nEdit\nI am well aware that in a strict logical sense any proposition is equivalent to a conditional, however it is in the latter sense alluded to in Joel's answer, that is: \n\nin any situation in which the axioms are true (or in which the background assumptions are correct), then p \n\nthat I am referring to conditionals. I am however not alluding to the strict axiomatic method, so much as the application of analytic reasoning to non-trivial background assumptions.

In this sense, if one allows propositions to qualify as \"conditionals\" when they are merely logically equivalent to conditionals, then the notion is simply too generous, since every statement will qualify. And otherwise, if one insists literally on an explicit conditional form, then the notion seems to be concerned with presentational style over substance. Thus, the class of statements-expressible-as-conditionals is not so robust logically.\nAnother way to make this point is that in principle, any philosophical work can be put explicitly into the desired conditional-only form, without changing the meaning of the work, by replacing every assertion p in the work with a conditional propositional equivalent to it, such as \u00acp \u2192 p. However, because this would clearly be silly, it is not clear what the substance of the property of \"expressed in conditionals\" really carries. \nSecond, I would like to mention that whenever one argues in an axiomatic system, such as in mathematics and perhaps other contexts as well, and even when one argues in a context of background assumptions, then there is an implicit intention that asserting p really means \"in any situation in which the axioms are true (or in which the background assumptions are correct), then p \"\n"}]}

Presumably posthumans and active mindfiles would have the same capabilities in terms of manipulating the intensity of their input sources.\nNow, if the machine doesn't have this sort of access to its \"mind,\" which seems likely at least in the earliest stages of development, it will be in roughly the same position with respect to suffering that modern humans are; i.e., its internal neurocognitive structure is effectively a 'black box' manipulating signals of its own accord, so the machine wouldn't have any opportunity to consciously interrupt the flow of pain-signals. \nFinally, the question of why you would cause a machine intelligence to feel pain also seems worth investigating to me. After all, it would seem possible to design a machine intelligence without providing an equivalent of 'physical' pain -- so why would we go out of our way to provide this \"benefit\"? Note that among sentient machines are likely to be uploaded human minds, which presumably would prefer not to experience physical suffering again; the pain response would seem more like an unfortunate meatspace necessity we would be gratefully ridding ourselves of (as with aging and death.)\nSo yes, in general, I think a sentient machine could suffer -- but again, with the strange caveat that once a given stage of development has been reached, it could potentially have a choice in the presence, degree and quality of suffering experienced at any given moment.

Since the capacity to suffer and feel pain is an important part of human mentality, one might expect that any animal or machine that is fully sentient would have the capacity to suffer. The ability to feel pain is surely a part of the full experience of our mentality. \nBut perhaps sentience does not require the full experience of our mentality, but only a part of it. In this case, I would separate your question from the machine aspect of your question, and reduce the issue merely to the question of whether the ability to suffer is a necessary condition for sentience. \nEven in the case of human beings, this doesn't seem to be the case. The reason I believe so is that we can easily imagine a person that has suffered some brain damage to the parts of their brains controlling the pain response, so that they are no longer able to experience pain or suffer in any way. Of course, such a condition would be debilitating, since it is precisely our ability to feel pain that protects us from and alerts us to many dangers in the world (burning, cutting, other injuries, etc.). Indeed, our ability to feel pain is surely a critical component of human survival (and there seems similar good reason to think that the pain capacity would be critical for the success of a thinking machine). Nevertheless, I think we can also easily imagine that a person might have such a pain disability without losing their ability to reason, think, write, experience joy, love, appreciate music and so on, having in all other respects a full mental life despite their disability.

If you do not have something to contrast then suffering is just normal life.  What is suffering is also different among people.  Masochists enjoy pain and abuse.

It must be able to make a decision what is pleasureable and what is not.  In order to suffer it must be able to choose to suffer.  \nOn what would be unethical:\nHumanity is likely to determine what the machine finds unpleasureable.  We will likely have a subset among us who would exploit that.  Some that would derive some perverse pleasure in causing the machine pain and suffering.  This would be as unethical as torturing an animal or another human.  And causing the termination of such a being for no reason would equally be unethical.

Thus (if I'm not mistaken) scientists recently confirmed that fish are sentient. And thus human fetuses acquire sentience at around 24 to 30 weeks into the pregnancy. But I take it you are using 'sentient' in the sci-fi sense of the word: i.e., the high-level capacity for human-like intelligence. Given the first sense of the word, the answer to \"Could a sentient machine suffer?\" is pretty simple: obviously yes, because the capacity to experience pain and pleasure is precisely what sentience is. But given the second sense of the word, the question is less simple, because it raises questions about the connection between intelligence and conscious experience, and the capacities of mere machines.\nEven if X can think, it doesn't obviously follow that X can experience. And thus even if mere machines can think, it doesn't obviously follow that mere machines have conscious experiences. The dualist philosopher David Chalmers famously argues that conscious experience cannot be naturalized into mere physics: i.e., no mere arrangement of physical stuff is sufficient to explain conscious experience, not without additional phenomenal properties linked to physical stuff by additional psychophysical laws. But I'm pretty sure he's more optimistic about naturalizing cognition into mere physics: i.e., mere physical systems might be capable of thinking on their own. But even if he's right about this, it might nevertheless be that any sort of physical system capable of engaging in thought will also (thanks to the psychophysical laws that actually obtain) have conscious experience: i.e., even if it's logically possible to have a thinking machine that cannot suffer, it might be nomologically impossible (impossible given the laws that govern the actual world).\nEven if suffering is of great moral significance, it doesn't follow that beings that can suffer have any rights. Bentham himself does not recognize animal rights, despite his view that their suffering matters as much as anybody's suffering. And even those friendlier to rights than Bentham commonly think that rights belong to a special category of morality that only rational agents like humans are eligible for. If this is right, then whether a sentient machine has rights would depend not just on its intelligence or its capacity for suffering, but on its capacity for rational decision-making and perhaps even on its capacity for free and autonomous decision-making of the sort Kantians champion.\n\n"}]}

And it's quite likely that pain and suffering would be a useful design decision in a sufficiently complicated (and resource-intensive) machine.\nIssac Asimov's third law of robotics suggests that a sentient machine would need to know when it is being damaged or at risk of being damaged.  Sensors that detect damage would be analogous to nerve-endings in humans and other animals (though likely based on different physical properties).  Presumably signals from those sensors would be designed to interrupt the normal function of machine and demand to be addressed immediately.  It's not clear that such signals would be experienced differently from what we call pain, if they are experienced at all.  (What I mean is that what constitutes \"experience\" is difficult to pin down, so robots might not experience anything and therefore not experience pain either.)\nNow good design would suggest that signals indicating damage of function would persist no longer than necessary to deal with the damage.  While the damage exists, the signals should continue and when the damage is repaired, the signals should subside.  Certain types of damage would be signaled with higher priority (or potentially greater intensity) than others as some types of damage would be more urgent and important than others.  Some signals would be of very low priority so that they could be ignored while pursuing more important goals.  A well-designed machine would even include senors that detect potential hazards such as high temperatures or high-speed collisions.\nIf a robot can be said to experience anything at all, it must also be able to experience a sensation we might call suffering.  Failure to sense damage would be a serious problem for all but the most trivial sentient machines.  I'm reminded of a book coauthored by Dr. Paul Wilson Brand, a pioneer in the treatment of leprosy or Hansen's disease.  The book points out the sufferers of congenital analgesia are at great risk of physical damage from activities the pose little threat to normal people such as sleeping, walking or eating.  Considering the difficulties faced by people who lack pain, we really aren't grateful enough for our occasional toothache or sore feet.\n"}]}

I assume that's what you mean by \"social analysis\".  Plato's Republic also does what I'd call \"social analysis\", but as you imply he tends to rely on first principles.)\nTo answer: it depends.  I disagree, for instance that the inductionist's \"entire analysis doesn't collapse if he's wrong\".  Afterall, empirical evidence suggested that atoms were the smallest possible unit of matter (hence the name) until further evidence showed that smaller entities existed.  As time goes on, the Atomist Theory becomes increasingly incorrect as more data is gathered.  \nMeanwhile, many of the practical conclusions of Plato have been shown to be wrong in the sense of accuracy, but his works are still very relevant today despite being built on assumptions that are no longer commonly held.  Many of his ideas can be recast into contemporary terms without disrupting his reasoning process drastically.  His theories of social stratification don't have much traction today, but his idea that society ought to be governed by rational principles holds up very well.\nPerhaps a better criteria for robustness is that general claims tend to be more robust in the face of error than specific claims, but specific claims tend to be more useful when correct.  \"Diamonds are hard\" is a general claim likely to survive any new information, but \"diamonds are the hardest material\" is a more specific (and useful) claim that may not survive new information.  Note that both these claims are inductive based on observation and not a priori assumptions.\n\nNot at all an answer to your question, but a personal opinion: Nietzsche (like Tolstoy and Pascal) seems far more a product of his time than Plato.  He seems like a niche philosopher who appeals to specific personalities and cultures more than to others.  His way of looking at the world doesn't appeal to me and therefore I have a difficult time following his lines of reasoning.  Pascal is the opposite for me: I get where he's coming from although I know many other people don't.  Meanwhile, both Plato and Aristotle, who come from opposite sides of the deductive/inductive spectrum, seem to hold up well from many people.

Malebranche, the famous Cartesian occasionalist, thought Descartes' argument could work fine with just a clear idea of the nature of matter as extension, without any need for a clear idea of the nature of the soul: see here. Other Cartesians agreed that the account of matter as extension shows the immateriality of the soul.\nAnother argument is based on the alleged unity of consciousness: since matter is a mere composite assemblage of parts, and I have only one consciousness (as opposed to a multitude of different consciousnesses), then my consciousness cannot be a mode of a material system. Pierre Bayle pushed this argument, as did Leibniz (see here) and Samuel Clarke (see here). Kant attacks it in the Paralogisms section of the 1st Critique, and offers a moral argument for the immortality of the soul in the 2nd Critique.\nAs for the empiricists, some of them were materialists (Hobbes, Gassendi, and arguably Hume). Berkeley was quite the opposite, arguing that matter was a self-contradictory philosopher's fiction. Locke and Hume both pushed something like an agnostic skepticism when it comes to the underlying substantial nature of the soul: Hume argued that the very question was unintelligible because we have no idea of substance.\nI don't know enough about the medievals to know how they argued for the immateriality of the soul.

The \"Socrates problem\", in the sense of \"the problem of the historical Socrates\" is quite unusual in that we possess no texts attributed to Socrates, but rather, three distinct reports of him (coming from Plato, Aristophanes, and Xenophon), each of whom had their own polemical purposes.  This problem does not apply to the vast majority of philosophers we're interested in, who left texts.\nSo, the question then becomes one of the interpretation of texts: how do we know when we have interpreted a text \"correctly\"?  Further, what would \"correctly\" mean in this case: the recovery of authorial intent?  The branch of philosophy [*] that these questions belong to is termed 'hermeneutics', and there exists a vast literature on the subject.  If one were interested in a historical view, Schleiermacher would be the place to start, but I wouldn't recommend that, for the following reason:\nThere exists a seminal text in hermeneutics, which stands as the sine qua non for all later work in the field: Truth and Method, by Hans-Georg Gadamer.  Attempting to discuss hermeneutics without reference to Gadamer would be like trying to discuss physics without recourse to Newton-- you'd spend half of your time reinventing his vocabulary, even if you wanted to disagree with him.\nIn short, if questions of interpretation interest you at all, there's not much point in going any further before you have grappled with this text.\nFortunately, it is available in English translation, ubiquitous at libraries, cheap in paperback, and easy to read.\nThus, in my opinion, there is only one answer to your question: take a look at Gadamer's \"Truth and Method\".  When there is a major philosophical text that deals directly with the fundamental problematic underlying your question, there's no other responsible answer than a simple referral to the text in question.  And, naturally, if for some reason one is unable to take the time to read the primary text, there are easily available secondary and tertiary resources which are easily found with the knowledge of the author and title of the primary work.\n[*] and/or philology, but that's a discussion for another day.\n"}]}

This, I believe, is the position of David Hume:\n\nIt seems evident, that men are carried, by a natural instinct or prepossession, to repose faith in their senses; and that, without any reasoning, or even almost before the use of reason, we always suppose an external universe, which depends not on our perception, but would exist, though we and every sensible creature were absent or annihilated. Even the animal creation are governed by a like opinion, and preserve this belief of external objects, in all their thoughts, designs, and actions.\nIt seems also evident, that, when men follow this blind and powerful instinct of nature, they always suppose the very images, presented by the senses, to be the external objects, and never entertain any suspicion, that the one are nothing but representations of the other. This very table, which we see white, and which we feel hard, is believed to exist, independent of our perception, and to be something external to our mind, which perceives it. Our presence bestows not being on it: our absence does not annihilate it. It preserves its existence uniform and entire, independent of the situation of intelligent beings, who perceive or contemplate it.\n\nAfter this, he proceeds to argue that philosophical analysis of the reliability of our senses and the uniformity of nature fails:\n\nSo far, then, are we necessitated by reasoning to contradict or depart from the primary instincts of nature, and to embrace a new system with regard to the evidence of our senses.  But here philosophy finds herself extremely embarrassed, when she would justify this new system, and obviate the cavils and objections of the sceptics. She can no longer plead the infallible and irresistible instinct of nature: for that led us to a quite different system, which is acknowledged fallible and even erroneous. And to justify this pretended philosophical system, by a chain of clear and convincing argument, or even any appearance of argument, exceeds the power of all human capacity.\n\nTo address the Theory of Grue, we must object to it not on the basis of deductive reasoning, but on the more fundamental basis of the reliability of our senses: green objects look green and our instincts suggest they will remain green and not magically turn blue in the future.  As we must begin all reasoning with the assumption of our own reliable senses, it is and always will be an axiom we must accept without justification.\n\nStraying from Hume, Popper and the question at hand, I should point out that the traditional justifications for the reliability of the senses and the uniformity of nature are:\n\nThe existence of some greater set of forms, which are sensible, that the material world copies, reflects or emulates.  (This is Plato's position.)\n\nThe a priori assumption that nature is sensible.  (Aristotle generally took this approach.)\n\n\nNeither justification is satisfactory for reasons that Hume points out.  Both must be taken as properly basic assumptions.\n"}]}

But\n  it's difficult to see how Grue Theory is different than, say, General\n  Relativity which waited several years for the technology needed to\n  produce definitive tests of the theory.\n\nPopper's Falsifiability criterion is a formal and logical one, and as such has nothing to do with the practical possibility or impossibility of testing a given hypothesis. It goes as follows:\nGiven that H is a hypothesis / theory, if and only if H is falsifiable then there exists a finite set of observation sentences \u0393 such that \u00ac H is a logical consequence of \u0393.\ni.e., according to the criterion there must exist, in principle (as opposed to in practice), a set of observation sentences that by being true make the hypothesis being tested false.\nIn order to be falsifiable, the Theory of Relativity needs only to provide such observation sentences, not the availability of real life execution method of the associated experiments.\nBack in 1916, Einstein provided a hypothesis which could, by definition, be tested -- by its own definition, that is. On the contrary, the Grue theory, by definition -- by its own definition -- cannot provide such testability in respect to itself, at least not at present. The Popperian reason behind the falsifiablity criterion, is that the attempts at refutation are what potentially corroborates a theory, so if no refutation is logically possible, no potential valid corroboration could be made, and so it isn't scientific.\nIn other words, General Relativity is testable per Popper because there isn't any logical contradiction between testing it and all the rest of background assumptions. In contrast, present testing of the Grue theory contradicts the fact that time travel is logically impossible, which I would guess to be found in its background assumptions.\nThe Popperian answer to the Grue theory in question would be, I presume, that it will be scientific once it'll be falsifiable in principle. If the Grue theory suggests also that the adequate time travel is logically possible then I guess it passes the criterion, but it does depend on that.\n\nDid Karl Popper directly address the uniformitarian assumption?\n\nNot that I am aware of, but I'll be happy to learn new things. One reason I can think of for him to not directly address the Unity of Nature is the fact that perhaps no such articulation of it exists in the form of a falsifiable theory.\nIn other words, Popper doesn't think this is of any special interest, as from his perspective, his program of the epistemology and methodology of science is perfectly consistent without it. You can suggest a general law of nature in the form of a hypothesis, have it stand in rigorous tests and as long as this situation holds the hypothesis is valid and tentatively true (which is, by principle, the best you can achieve under the Popperian doctrine). If, one day, new experiments show the hypothesis to fail a relevant test (even if it's \"the same\" test it had previously stood), then it is now refuted. It took some time but now it's there, along with all other refuted theories -- the cause for the \"sudden\" acceptance of the hypothesis as refuted is irrelevant; whether it's due to new testing technique or due to a change in \"nature's mechanics\" is beside the point of it being refuted.\n"}]}

In other words, we might find evidence against a scientific claim not because it was incorrect when it was formulated, but because Nature dramatically changed her rules sometime later or in a different region of the Universe.  A hypothetical example proposed by Nelson Goodman, is that there is no way to tell the difference between green and grue, which is an imaginary color that looks green until some point in the distant future when it will look blue to the eye.  Note that the existence of grue is trivially falsified by observation after the moment in the future when its appearance changes.\nPresumably, Popper would suggest Occam's razor would reject the concept of grue.  But that presupposes that the law of parsimony holds true, which isn't obvious.  Popper suggests that, 'We prefer simpler theories to more complex ones \"because their empirical content is greater; and because they are better testable\"'.  But that seems to me either a very practical reason untied to the actual truth of the law or simply begging the question.  \nOr perhaps he would say that Grue Theory isn't really falsifiable and therefore isn't a scientific theory until it can be falsified.

In some ways, Grue Theory has the advantage in that it points to a specific moment when its claim can be definitively tested, unlike most scientific theories.\nDid Karl Popper directly address the uniformitarian assumption?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think Popper addresses the supposed uniformity principle as it is related to the problem of induction in \"Realism and the Aim of Science\" by Popper, in Chapter I Section 4. David Deutsch discusses it in \"The Beginning of Infinity\" Chapter 1. See also the introduction to \"Realism and the Aim of Science\" for a discussion of grue.\nNote that no such principle could possibly save inductivism from criticism. Any such principle could not be obtained from experimental data since the data are interpreted in terms of that principle. Also, saying that nature is uniform doesn't specify the exact form of the uniformity and so is useless for scientific discovery. Our best current guess at a theory of gravity is general relativity, which is a different guess about what rules hold uniformly than Newtonian gravity.\nPopper would say that an alternative to some current theory should be considered if it makes predictions other than the prediction it was originally invented to explain. His reason for saying this is that the only way to decide between ideas is by criticism, they cannot be proven or shown to be probably true or anything like that: they cannot be justified. Any justifying argument makes assumptions and uses rules of inference that have not been shown to be true or valid, so the conclusions of such an argument have not been shown to be true or valid. (See Chapter I of \"Realism and the Aim of Science\".)   This means that every argument is question begging in the sense of being unjustified. Rather than being justified, ideas are conjectured solutions to problems and they are controlled by elimination through criticism. So experiment can only ever be used to eliminate ideas, not to prove them. Since we can only eliminate an idea by experiment, an idea that makes only a single prediction that differs from other ideas is extremely difficult to test. This is an unanswered criticism of such an idea and so eliminates it from consideration.\nAnother problem with such an idea is that it is a bad explanation. It amounts in substance to adding a qualification to an idea that does explain stuff. As such it ruins an existing explanation and provides no replacement. See \"The Fabric of Reality\" by David Deutsch, Chapter 7. How does this apply specifically to grue? Well, if the grue idea just says that the colour of some blue crystal will change to green and nothing else, then it is worthless: call this the ad hoc grue theory. The current blue properties are explained by ideas about the atoms and their arrangement in a crystal and that sort of thing. The ad hoc grue theory ruins this explanation and provides no replacement. Furthermore, arguably it's not actually testable. For example, suppose that it predicts the crystal will turn green at midnight on 27 January 2015. What happens if I take the crystal up in a plane at 11pm UK time and fly to a place where it is past midnight and then back again. Will the crystal change from blue to green and back again as I cross the line at which the time officially changes? There can be no non-arbitrary way to decide that without an account of why the colour changes. What happens if I put it in a box and say that inside the box midnight on 27 January 2015 never happens? Since the usual calendar convention is suspended will the crystal never change colour? What happens if I accelerate the crystal to near the speed of light so that the time elapsed for the crystal between when it was created and 27 January 2015 is a million years, or a billion or 10^10^10^10^9 years? When will it change colour?\nA theory that predicts the colour change as a result of some property of the crystal or whatever will have other consequences and so will be independently testable, e.g. - it might say things about atoms or crystal structure that differ from the standard theory. As such there will be some other way to test it.\nNote that since there is no way to solve the grue problem without an explanation, it is impossible to solve it using inductivism. According to inductivism we get ideas and justify them by experimental observation but this is impossible and so inductivism does not provide any solution to the grue problem.\n"}]}

Should there be myriads of liars and a high enough number of murderers, this tells us nothing on the moral values of lying or murder.  \nThe \u201cmoral justification\u201d always connects with a certain moral doctrine that is presupposed.

Why should the right to lie be refused even in the case where a lie would save a human life? Kant gives two arguments:\n\nAny lie, whatsoever its reasons are, constitutes an injustice towards humanity in its entirety, because in allowing ourselves to lie, this action results that statements in general do not find credibility, and that, consequently, all rights that are founded on understanding fall equally. \nThe second argument is more singular, because it consists in warning temptation to accept the \u201cwell-intentioned\u201d lie against detrimental consequences that may result from it: \nIf you have, for example, prevented by a lie someone with murderous intentions to act, you are responsible on a legal standpoint of all consequences of the outcome. But if you held yourself strictly to the truth, public justice can do nothing to you whatsoever the unforeseen consequences be. \n\nThis is an utilitarian type of argumentation: it\u2019s good for humanity in its entirety that the principle of word given can be held as valid; it\u2019s always preferable for me not to lie, it\u2019s the strategy that will spare the troubles in which we fall inescapably as soon as we start lying.\nThe foundation of morality is the respect of the moral law written in the heart of conscience. \u2013 Kantian ethics.\nNB: Moral ethic of intention to act freely, by respect of moral law and not by desires or dispositions. Moral value is not placed in the goal to attain, but higher, on a principle that determines the work in question. An individual act is moral when it\u2019s determined to act by respect of the practice of moral law. \n\nMoral laws are hypothetical, conditional imperatives. \u2013 Utilitarian ethics.\nNB: Reasons are not important, only consequences. You cannot see or measure the motives of people, but only the consequences of their actions. \n\nMoral laws are categorical imperatives. \u2013 Kantian ethics.\nNB: Duty to always obey morality. \n\nKant virtually acknowledges that the interest of mankind collectively,\n  or at least of mankind indiscriminately, must be in the mind of the\n  agent when conscientiously deciding on the morality of the act. \n\nUtilitarianism, John Stuart Mill.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo give any meaning to Kant's principle, the sense put upon it must\n  be, that we ought to shape our conduct by a rule which all rational\n  beings might adopt with benefit to their collective interest.\n\nUtilitarianism, John Stuart Mill.\n\n\nAs close to the categorical imperative this formulation may seem, it\u2019s still reductive and leads finally to misreading what constitutes the nerve in the metaphysics of morals. The collective interest of humanity does not suffice in defining moral duty.\nKant explains it clearly: \n\nA fourth, who is in prosperity, while he sees that others have to\n  contend with great wretchedness and that he could help them, thinks:\n  'What concern is it of mine? Let everyone be as happy as Heaven\n  pleases, or as be can make himself; I will take nothing from him nor\n  even envy him, only I do not wish to contribute anything to his\n  welfare or to his assistance in distress!' Now no doubt if such a mode\n  of thinking were a universal law, the human race might very well\n  subsist and doubtless even better than in a state in which everyone\n  talks of sympathy and good-will, or even takes care occasionally to\n  put it into practice, but, on the other side, also cheats when he can,\n  betrays the rights of men, or otherwise violates them. But although it\n  is possible that a universal law of nature might exist in accordance\n  with that maxim, it is impossible to will that such a principle should\n  have the universal validity of a law of nature. For a will which\n  resolved this would contradict itself, inasmuch as many cases might\n  occur in which one would have need of the love and sympathy of others,\n  and in which, by such a law of nature, sprung from his own will, he\n  would deprive himself of all hope of the aid he desires. \n\nGroundwork of the metaphysics of morals, Immanuel Kant\n\n\nThis fourth who is in prosperity is described by Marx. It\u2019s the selfish bourgeois that puts forward that everyone follows his own ends and that it\u2019s the least harm we can do for the entirety of humanity. On the factual map, Kant admits the premises of this reasoning. Rational selfishness is without doubt a good move and could even be profitable to humanity. But we cannot want it without contradicting ourselves. Therefore, an applicable and advantageous principle to the entirety of humanity is not sufficient; it still has that I may want it as I am a rational-reasonable being.\n\nFourthly, as regards meritorious duties towards others: The natural\n  end which all men have is their own happiness. Now humanity might\n  indeed subsist, although no one should contribute anything to the\n  happiness of others, provided he did not intentionally withdraw\n  anything from it; but after all this would only harmonize negatively\n  not positively with humanity as an end in itself, if every one does\n  not also endeavour, as far as in him lies, to forward the ends of\n  others. For the ends of any subject which is an end in himself ought\n  as far as possible to be my ends also, if that conception is to have\n  its full effect with me. \n\nGroundwork of the metaphysics of morals,\n  Immanuel Kant\n\n\nUtilitarians place themselves on the map of our spontaneous tendencies and what is feasible without contradiction whereas Kant breaks radically with this conception in placing himself from the human will perspective. \nI can so I want, says the utilitarian. I must, so I can, replies Kant. \nAt the same time, this shows how much utilitarians are far from having the depth and amplitude of sight required by moral philosophy. \n"}]}

Surely you wouldn't simplify to 'pleasure' or 'happiness' as you did in a passing comment.  If I lived my life to make myself as happy as possible, I'd be miserable, and if I can't maximize my own happiness, how on earth can I maximize yours?  \nIf there are practical applications of this sort of ethical thought, they're probably best applied narrowly within some context like \"consumers of family-sized snack products.\"  In this simplified world, society has a production constraint (we can only make so many doritos) and an aggregate utility curve (we can only be so pleasured).  \nIf we give all the Doritos to you, by this theory, you will be as happy as you can be, but your marginal happiness-pleasure-utility from Dorito infinity-plus-one will be far less than the near orgasm I would have obtained from dorito not-plus-one.  So we can allude to 'Pareto' optimality and argue that it'd be great if your last Dorito went to me, following the logic until we get to something like, 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his appetite for family-sized dorito megapacks.'  \nRather than asking you, 'what is happiness?,' maybe it's more interesting to ask, 'how much context is necessary to talk about any person's pleasure/utility/happiness?'  Is there non-contextual happiness or even happiness-as-a-state?  If happiness is related to pleasure, I think your 'happiness' now has everything to do with your happiness yesterday.  Since you got all those dorito packs yesterday, today you'd need an unbelievable quantity to 'have a good day.'  Essentially, you've developed a tolerance for doritos, and by doritos I mean utility.\n"}]}

He did not free the slaves that existed in states that remained in the Union.  He was responsible for the single greatest power grab by the federal government in history.  And he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans much of which could have been avoided had Lincoln been willing to allow reunification once it was clear that the south was defeated.  Instead he chose a path of conquest.  Many people who were pro-Union and anti-slavery in the south suffered and lost as a result of the land they owned being in a slave state.\n\nWas it not designed to provide checks and balances on power?\n\nYes.  As far as I am concerned this was the most egregious violation of basic human rights, and to the rights of the states to be soveriegn entities as well.\n\nThe argument I got when discussing this today was \"he was in uncharted\n  waters and did what was necessary\". So the more general question is,\n  when and how does one deem it necessary to break the rules.\n\nThere were other options.  Slavery was near its end because of the industrial revolution.  It was a flash point political issue of the time.  There was never any intention to treat the slaves as actual people.  In fact the union was very much against that in the first place.\nLincoln was essentially beatified in US Culture after his death because of the need of the symbol.  Our christan roots elevated martyrdom despite any shortcomings or actual achievements.  It is indeed possible that the victory of the Union held back both persons of color and women from full acceptance as persons of equal value to while males.  The liberated slaves no longer had work or anyone to provide for their families.  Many were allowed to starve to death after all they were not human beings what did it matter?  The labor that the slaves provided was replaced by machines.  Most of them run by white men.  \nA person can choose to break the rules knowing that there will be consequenses.  It is never ok for a government to break the rules on those they govern's behalf.  There are methods to change the rules.  There are instances of specific exceptions (See the 14th amendment) to rules that exist.  To me any blatent violation of the constitution, reguardless of the reason, is Treason pure and simple.  I dont care if it is authorizing the abduction and torture of terror suspects, or using power to coverup and facilitate violations of the constitution.  \nGovernments that are created to be bound by rules set in place, have a covenent with the people to operate under prescribed conditions.  When the governement or a member of the government acting as an agent of the government they are breaking that covnent with the people.  This is at its worst treason.  The governement has the power to destroy and cause the deaths of millions of not just its own citizens.  This power is granted with the limitations imposed.  The usurping of power not granted and especially that which is expressly forbidden to it, is a form of the highest crime against those it governs.  It risks the very legitimacy of the nation and its government when it does so.  \n"}]}

In addition, perhaps we can find the germ of Lincoln's justification (and the outrage of those who have opposed his justification) in the words that launched the United State of America as a nation:\n\nWhen in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. \u2014 That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2014 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\n\nWhat this remarkable statement says is that the British government systematically and sustainedly denied the people of the colonies to what it calls \"unalienable Rights\" endowed by man's Creator.  Because the previous Government was not constructive, but \"destructive of these ends\", it became necessary for the colonies \"to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with [Britain]\".  It's not explicitly stated here, but the colonies did not have the power to alter the previous Government and therefore was left only with the power to abolish it.\nIt appears that the Southern states saw the US Government in much the same light as the Founding Fathers saw the British Government.  It seems that Lincoln did not see things that way.  His most well-known, and perhaps best, statement of his position on the war comes from his Gettysburg Address:\n\nFour score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\nNow we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.\nBut, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\n\nHere, Lincoln seems to justify the civil war as necessary on the same grounds as the Revolutionary War was necessary.  He seems to take the earlier Declaration of Independence as higher priority than the Constitution, which came later.  He certainly played hard and fast with the rules, if he didn't violate his constitutional powers outright.  He justified himself (whether rightly or wrongly) by appealing to a higher rule: \"that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\"\nSo I think a legitimate grounds for violating a rule is in the service of a greater rule.  That's why the police are allowed to speed and double-park when pursuing criminals.\n"}]}

Because here the one who chooses the decision has no right (as we generally assume it to be) to kill somebody(has no way to assertain that he is ethically right).\nWe need to find out the root cause for laws to be there; Usually it is to overcome chaos and anarchism.

But then the question goes to what ethics is.

Although his or her parents could have freely decided to become members of a certain nation, to what extent is the country legitimized in extending its authority over the newborn?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The primary philosophical justification for this in governmental or political terms is social contract theory. Essentially, social contract theory is the viewpoint that both a person's moral and political obligations derive from an agreement that they have made (implicitly or explicitly) with their society (or government). Social contract theorists argue that this type of agreement is vital to forming a society, and in fact, much of modern Western moral and political theory is derived out of the work of the famous triumvirate of social contract theorists: Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\nThere are various justifications for this theory, depending on which of the three social contractarians you choose to read. But most of them agree that humans abandoned the natural state (where all beings were completely free to do as they liked) in order to enter into an ordered society that revokes some of their natural liberties in order to provide them with collective benefits such as security and protection. The fundamental idea is essentially that the rights required to be given up have less net desirability than those rights that can only be ensured and protected by a government or society.\nNow, you might argue, that this is all well and good for the parents of that child, but what of the child itself? It clearly isn't old enough at the time that it is born to have agreed to comply with any type of contract, social or otherwise. You seem to be driving at exactly this argument when you say:\n\nAlthough his or her parents could have freely decided to become members of a certain nation, to what extent is the country legitimized in extending its authority over the newborn?\n\nWell, the answer is a fairly simple one, and certainly one that the social contract theorists anticipated. There have been only very few instances in which human beings have actually gotten together and signed a written contract\u2014in keeping with the relatively Western nature of this philosophy, the Magna Carta is often cited as the canonical example. In the rest of cases, indeed the majority of cases, the consent to this social contract is assumed to be implicit, or tacit.\nThe argument usually goes something like this: By virtue of choosing to remain in the territory which is under a particular social contract, the individual has tacitly given consent to be governed by that society and therefore give up his/her individual rights as required to gain the larger benefits of that society. In fact, the argument goes, this tacit consent (the ability of people to \"vote with their feet\") is what gives the government its legitimacy.\nTo answer your question more specifically, I'll focus on the writings of John Locke, arguably the most influential and widely-known of the social contract theorists.\nLocke says that simply walking along the roads of a particular jurisdiction is tantamount to tacit, or implied, consent to the laws of that government. A person agrees to obey the laws of a society while it is living within the territory of that society. He says that this explains why resident aliens are obligated to obey the laws of whatever state in which they reside, even though they are not naturalized citizens of that society. This obligation no longer holds when they return to their country of origin, but it necessarily attaches while they take up residence in that particular jurisdiction.\nAnd the idea of property ownership (a recurring theme throughout Locke's philosophical views) becomes important here as well. If a person inherits property, then that works to create an even stronger bond between the individual and the commonwealth. The idea is that the original owner of that property agreed to place this property permanently under the jurisdiction of the commonwealth or society, and that by inheriting this property, the inheritor also inherits the obligation to follow the laws of that society.\nSo when children accept the property of their parents, they also tacitly consent to the jurisdiction of the commonwealth and agree to abide by the rules of the social contract. \nFor more on this line of thought, I highly recommend picking up a copy of John Locke's seminal work, The Second Treatise of Government. It's a relatively short little book (as these things go), and well worth a read for anyone curious about the nature of governmental sovereignty and implied consent.\n"}]}

It is an overbroad generalization that countries are seeking legitimization by declaring children born in their country as citizens.  The child is subject of the laws of the land in which he resides unless he is considered part of a diplomatic delegation.  A French child in the US is subject to US laws.  A US Child in France is subject to Frnech law. \nCitizenship conveys rights to an individual.  Governments impose laws over an area in which they claim jurisdiction.  Anyone inside that jurisdiction is required to abide by the laws of that government.  Failure to do so results in penalties.  Citizenship conveys rights, often to work, own property, vote, etc.  Many governments even go so far as to provide protection and assistance to their citizens while traveling abroad.  Most countries control who can come in to their country, rather than who can leave.  In addition most countries allow for you to renounce your citizenship if you desire.  While there are oppressive realms that refuse this most free countries find this as a sign of weakness not strength and deligitimizes rather than legitimizing it.  \nAs for the rights of children, the child has the same rights. The power to exercise them simply belongs to their guardian (Usually parent). This is because as children we are sometimes unable to make rational decisions. We grant children the right to make mistakes and not have it held against them in the future. So a rash decision by a 10 year old to renounce his citizenship does not mean he has to move away from his family.  \n"}]}

As the existing population of a nation is destined to grow old and die, a nation requires an increase in younger population to ensure it's survival in the future. So, a nation more or less chooses it's survival over the rights of the children (and the adults as well).\nb) Rights/Expectations of older people: A member of the population expects some compensation in his older years (e.g. an old age home, health care etc.) For this compensation to be delivered, a younger population must be ready to bear the cost for this (just like the european nations). \nFor both these reasons, it's essential for the nation to replace its elderly population by younger people. Now, it could be argued  that this could be done after a person reaches a certain age by giving everybody a choice on whether or not to join a state. (say 18, though this question/answer shows how totally unjustified that age is). However, that raises two issues:\na) Should the state spend resources on those below the age of 18 without some sort of compensation?\nb) Should the state try to maximise the number of people joining, and if yes, how?\nEven if a) is ignored, most nations would find it pretty convenient to set up things so that as few people reject the nation as possible. The best way to do is to \"enslave\" them from childhood. \nFurthermore, the Asch conformity experiments show that the presence of even a small minority can lead to drastic drops in conformity.

The problem isn't so much getting them to adhere to it -- but rather, doing it without coercion.  Otherwise, what gives YOU the right...it will be hard to explain.\n"}]}

These are especially common, as to give an example, in Mathematics, where \"irrefutable starting points\" form the building ground for all other theorems. Eg: Can we prove that numbers are infinite? No, we can't, but we generally consider them to be as to serve our purposes. On the other hand, we can't prove numbers aren't infinite either, but this isn't relevant to what concerns our learning. What we are interested in is that we can take any arbitrary value and make it as high or low as we want to.\nThe second case, on the other hand, is based on pure observation. Whereas the first case accepted an array of axioms to prove its point, hence could result in \"final\" conclusions, this second method cannot reach such a level of certainty due to the lack of a \"general theorem\". In fact, this type of analysis generates \"theories\", such as gravity. There is no formal proof for gravity, which is why we call it \"the theory of gravity\". That is because, due to the lack of fixed started points, we can only limit our conclusions to \"all that has been so far observed\".\nThis second type of analysis, that of empirical sciences, states that something is true so long as it is not proven false.

I think among the interlocutors we can distinguish roughly three categories:\n\nuseful idiots\ngenuinely different views\nstraw men\n\n\"Useful idiots\" are those views that exist to help us see an obvious reply to an obvious objection. Thus, they say something we might first think when we hear an idea. And this gives Socrates the chance to explain how that does not apply to the view he is trying to articulate. This sort of dialectical method is also central to Hegel where the negative is necessary to move forward because it highlights what is wrong with the currently held view.\nI do think there are some genuinely different views voiced at points during the Republic, Parmenides, and also the Laws and several of the later dialogues. There are questions raised where Socrates does not win or at least where as a reader we are not compelled to agree.\nThere are still some straw men of course. But I don't think Plato is our worst offender on that point. And what makes them strawmen is if they articulate views that someone genuinely holds in a way that does not do justice to that view.\nSo for instance in contemporary philosophy, not every objection I include in a paper is one that I really expect someone to raise. Instead, some are to dispel misunderstandings before they happen. Often the best way to avoid this is to quote, but there's really not much lying around for Plato to quote.

This is an unnatural and unstable state.  If you release something into a void it attempts to quickly disperse filling the void as much as possible.  Similarly upon creation objects try to disperse.    In a strange coincodence or maybe design things also attract each other.  So while nature wants voids filled, matter wants to be together.  As a result you end up with collections of particles scattered through out the universe.  \nSpace is not truely empty.  There are an effectively infintite number of atoms and particles out there.  They are mostly dispersed so as to have an effective pressure approaching 0 through out the majority of the universe.  But there are particles there.  When they get close enough together and have enough attraction they couple.  Eventually that couple collects more or becomes part of a larger collection.  \nSo there is something because that is a more stable state.  There are theories that there is antimatter collections in the universe that would cancel out most matter but the dispersal of matter/antimatter sometimes happens before the 2 can cancel each other out. \n-- Edit addressing some Ben Hockings concerns\nI propose that you can not sum space time.  Thus there can be no totality of spacetime.  That it may be infinite and immeasurable.  That we indeed exist because that is a more natural state.  That the universe as you have defined it expands to fill a limitless nothing because that is a more natural state than containing nothing.  \nLimitless is not the same as being infinitely large.  It is nothing thus it has no size, and is not defined by our space time.  No displacement is neccessary as there is nothing to displace.  The universe expands to fill something that has no volume, or capacity thus can not be filled.  \nIn some ways we agree that the void does not exist as part of our space time.  But I deny that our spacetime contains the totality of all that is.  The scientist in me would love to limit everything to the limits that transcribe.  That would imply that the potential is there to understand everything even if the reality of that approaches the impossible.  But logically that makes no sense.

It's hard to find anything that corresponds to that and I therefore put it at the beginning of one of my books. I reduced it to what I thought were the bare essentials, which are very similar to the ones you came up with earlier, which were:\n\nanything that happens, happens\nanything that in happening causes something else to happen, causes something else to happen\nanything that in happening causes itself to happen again, happens again\n\nIn fact you don't even need the second two because they flow from the first one, which is self-evident and there's nothing else you need to say; everything else flows from that.\nSo, I think we have in our grasp here a fundamental, ultimate truth, against which there is no gain-saying.

Lee Smolin discussed his evolving universes idea with Richard Dawkins (who was a good friend of D.A.) here.\nIn both the origin-of-life and the origin-of-everything there were earlier proto forms that were very ropey and odd and inefficient and not what we think of as an actual universe/lifeform at all.

Otherwise, one would put himself in the dubious position of assuming that the appeal to non-existence somehow explains existence. (The trend in philosophy since Plato, and perhaps long before him, is to posit some form of consciousness as the \u201canswer\u201d to such questions, even though this tactic is irrescindably incoherent.)\nThus, by posing this question and assuming that it is valid, you implicitly (but unavoidably) commits yourself to the fallacy of the stolen concept. If we ask why something is, but simply turn around and posit that something in our explanation of that something, what mileage have we gained? Indeed, we\u2019re back to where we started, yet we don\u2019t admit it to ourselves. This is what you do in assuming that the question \u201cWhy is there something rather than nothing?\u201d (or \u201cWhy does existence exist?\u201d) is a valid question. One will have to assume the fact of existence in order to answer the question. But in so doing, he will have to deny the fact of existence in order to validate his assumption that there must be a reason why there is something rather than nothing. He must assume the very concept his argument wants to deny, thus \u2018stealing\u2019 it from the objective hierarchy of knowledge, and rendering invalid any conclusion he hopes to draw from his argument.\nExistence exists. We must start somewhere. The theist wants to start with a form of consciousness. He wants to posit a mind (albeit supernatural) which is responsible for creating all its objects. This is called metaphysical subjectivism, a view which holds that existence finds its source in a form of consciousness.\nSome may object to my characterization of the question \u201cWhy is there something rather than nothing?\u201d as fallacious, contesting that there is no such thing as a fallacious question. However, it is true when we examine issues in epistemology and logic, that there is a such thing as an invalid question. The fallacy known as \u2018complex question\u2018, for instance, is a species of invalid question. It is a question which operates on a false assumption and expects the reader to accept that false assumption in order to answer it. The typical example is the question \u201cHave you stopped beating your wife?\u201d The question assumes that one is a married man and that he beats or has beaten his wife; indeed, it implies such beatings are a regular occurrence. Contrary to these assumptions, however, it could be the case a) that he is not married, or b) that he is married but has never beaten his wife. Since the question is asked in a manner in which a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 response can be the only appropriate reply, one cannot answer it on its own terms and avoid affirming its erroneous premises. One would implicate himself simply by answering. The question is fallacious because it leads one to accept a false premise, assuming either a) or b) are the actual case, if he should choose to take it seriously.\nLikewise, a question which leads one to commit a fallacy in order to answer it is also invalid. If taken seriously, the question \u201cWhy is there something rather than nothing?\u201d will lead one to commit the fallacy of the stolen concept; indeed, the fallacy of the stolen concept is unavoidable on the question\u2019s own terms, as we saw above. One would have both to assume and deny existence in order to address the question. If Martin Heidegger ,who originally asked this question, did not recognize this, it was principally because he was not operating on a fully rational philosophy. Yet, today we have theists assuming this question is valid all the time in the construction of their apologetic ruses. What is it that theists want to posit in response to their invalid questions so as to appear to satisfy them? Of course, they assume that the only logical answer is to assert a universe-creating, reality-ruling form of consciousness, which they call God, and delight themselves with this as their answer, never allowing themselves to recognize that the question leads them to accepting a stolen concept, and assuming that their arguments justifying this illicit move make it valid.\n"}]}

While there is no guarantee that such a system of patterns is powerful and expressive enough to reason about the necessity of all that is, we can still examine what can we reasonably say and understand about this.\nLet us begin by finding out the difference between Something and Nothing.\nObviously they are opposites - first word denotes the present state of affairs of all that is and the other one its negation. We can be fairly confident that right now Something is and Nothing is not.\nSo why is it this way? Could there be Nothing instead of Something? Turns out the answer is surprisingly simple and straightforward: if Nothing could be, then it would inevitably be Something - giving us a contradiction with our initial premises, thus demonstrating that Nothing cannot be.\nIn other words, there is Something because it cannot be otherwise - it is an inevitability that arises from the complete, utter and total incapacity of Nothing to exist as such.\nA more formal version of the same argument can be found from @anon's answer.\nIn short: Something is because Nothing is not.\nOr to quote \"The Way Of Truth\" by Parmenides: For never shall this prevail, that things that are not are.\n\n\nAn update in response to comment by OP\n\nThis is not circular reasoning. You are missing the point that we reason only through language which is a limited system of rules. Breaking a rule results in error.\nThe above question makes the error of assuming that non-being can be. It is self-contradictory. In the same way one can ask why is there no darkness in light or why is there no silence in sound.\nApparently you presume that if there is a word (\"nothing\"), then it must have an object, i.e. a correspondence with something beyond your own imagination.

A complete definition is equivalent to an edge or boundary defining what is contained within and giving \"substance\" and existence to the thing. \nIn regard to the question of \"Why is there something rather than nothing?\", \"nothing\", or \"non-existence\" is first defined to mean: no energy, matter, volume, space, time, thoughts, concepts, mathematical truths, etc.; and no minds to think about this lack-of-all.  Next, I propose that this \"non-existence\" itself, and not our mind's conception of non-existence, in and of itself completely describes or defines the entirety of all that is present.  Therefore, as a complete definition of what is present, what has traditionally been called \"nothing\", or \"non-existence\", is actually an existent state.  That is, what has traditionally been called \"nothing\" is, when seen from a different perspective, an existent state or \"something\".  \nAnother way to reach this same conclusion is by saying that in regard to the question of \"Why is there something rather than nothing?\", there are two choices for answering this question: \nA. \"Something\" has always been here.  \nB. \"Something\" has not always been here.  \nChoice A is possible but does not explain anything.  Therefore, choice B is the only choice with any explanatory power.  With choice B, if \"something\" has not always been here, then \"nothing\" must have been here before it.  \"Nothing\" is defined as above.  But, in this complete \"nothing, there would be no mechanism present to change this \"nothingness\" into the \"something\" that is here now.  Because we can see that \"something\" is here now, the only possible choice then is that \"nothing\" and \"something\" are one and the same thing.  This is logically required if we go with choice B.  \nNow, instead of saying \"That can't be.  Something and nothing are not the same\", it's better to try and figure out how these two logically-required equivalent things can really be the same.  The reason, I believe, is as described above that what has traditionally been called \"nothing\" completely describes, or defines, the entirety of what is present, and is therefore actually not \"nothing\", but is really an existent state. \nOverall, I come to the conclusion that many others have come to which is that having true non-existence is not possible because even what we have traditionally thought of as true non-existence is really an existent state when seen from a different angle.  Non-existence is basically a misnomer that has come about because we've been thinking of non-existence in our minds, which exist.  Next to our existent minds, nothing just looks like nothing.  But, nothing, or non-existence, itself, and not our mind's conception of non-existence, isn't dependent on being defined as the lack of existence.  It's on its own and, on its own, completely describes the entirety of what is there and is thus really an existent state.  In this (and all) areas, it's very important to distinguish between our mind's conception of non-existence and non-existence itself in which all minds along with everything else are gone.\nThis may all seem to be a waste of time, but the above reasoning provides a reason for why things exist and by trying to figure out the properties of the particular existent state previously referred to as non-existence allows one to build a model of the universe that is based on these properties via what I call \"philosophical engineering\".  This model has symmetry breaking, a natural reason for why energy exists and a big bang like expansion of space.  \nA more thorough discussion of the above idea along with some responses to critiques is at my website at: https://sites.google.com/site/ralphthewebsite/filecabinet/why-things-exist-something-nothing \nAlso, some discussion of this has also taken place recently at google.com/groups in the epistemology and everything-list groups and many years ago at a digital philosophy group. \n"}]}

What I'll try to do below is bringing up some random reasoning to luckily connect a synapse in the OP's brain that makes sense. Because, in all truth, there is just nothing (instead of something) that can be said to answer the question as whole to everyone! :-)\nFor instance, back in 2005 I figured, for myself, the answer to \"what's the reason of life, existence, and all things\" to be there is no reason. To my neural network, that makes so much sense that the exact instant I came to this answer, with that exact wording, [I felt a formication in my brain (read the description, I've uploaded that video)][1] like never before or afterwards.\nBack to the topic...\nIt can all be reduced to grouping things and defining words.\nLet's define universe to everything that can possibly affect us somehow.\nAnd let's define the nothing opposite to something as NOTHING, all in uppercase, in contrast to using semantics for talking about an empty group, the regular usage for nothing.\nSo, first, let's finally suppose you meant time (or space time) itself broader than the universe.\n(1) spacetime > universe\nThen it doesn't matter if there is NOTHING at any point.\nNOTHING could have existed outside the universe group, at some point. Though it may also be the case that NOTHING never existed. It certainlly haven't existed inside our universe because if it did it would have affected us and there would be nothing instead of something. Since it's outside our universe, it can't matter, by definition. Nothing that exists outside of the universe matters to us.\nBut then we have two different groups (which might be the premise of your question): the NOTHING and the something, which includes the universe defined above.\nIf we were at the NOTHING group, we couldn't possibly be reasoning about it, by definition. So we are in the something group. There is something right now. There might be nothing at a place and time out of our universe - it can't matter.\nNow let's go to the other possibility and assume...\n(2) universe > spacetime\nFor whatever that means. Maybe the big bang created spacetime. Maybe there are things before the big bang which can affect us.\nIn any case, the universe includes some physical constraints that goes way and beyond anything we currently understand by reality.\nEven then. If NOTHING was inside the universe group, it would be able to affect us. Again, what's a \"NOTHING instead of something\" which can affect us? It can only be, by definition something that would make it impossible anything to exist - or else there would be something.\nOr worse the, NOTHING is inside the spacetime group. But wait, how can NOTHING even be inside any grouping?! If it exists anywhere alongside something it's alraedy not opposite to something!!\nOk... But wait! Why do we even exist then?!\nThat's a whole different question. The answer is: we have no fucking clue.\nThen again, think of it this way: if there ever was an absolute NOTHING, how could anything come to exist? Answer is: there couldn't. That alone is already reason enough for something to exist. Else, NOTHING would be eternal and, well, what's the point in THAT?! ;P\nThe more you deeply reason about it\nThe more you can realize there could never, ever, be NOTHING.\n"}]}

One cannot ask questions which have no translation to observations, and in this case, one cannot ask \"what would it be like if there were nothing?\" Nor can we ask \"what is the relative probability of something rather than nothing?\" other than in the trivial sense of 100% certainty of something, because here it is.\nIt is very easy to fool your brain into asking nonsense questions. These are question which cannot be translated into sense impressions, whose answers have no bearing on the observations. Examples of these questions:\n\nDo the He atoms in the sun support the Republican or Democratic candidate for US president?\nWhere is the number 7 located?\nHow much does Mac OSX software weigh?\n\nQuestions of this sort come up in physics all the time, and physicists have become exceptionally good at smelling when a question is nonsense:\n\nWhat is the precise position of an electron in the ground state of an H atom?\nDoes the object thrown into a black hole really cross the horizon, or just get smeared out on the surface?\nAre quarks actually particles, or do the hadrons simply appear as if they are made out of quarks?\nWhich is the true value of the photon propagator Feynman's or Landau's ( $g_{\\mu\\nu}\\over k^2$ or ${g_{\\mu\\nu} - {k_\\mu k_\\nu\\over k^2} \\over k^2$)?\n\nThese questions are completely ridiculous, physics doesn't answer them and doesn't admit that they need an answer. There are tons more, and you find as many as you like the more you delve into physics. This comes up right at the start, with the question \"where is the coordinate zero in the Cartesian coordinates of the world located, really?\" But these questions can fool the brain into thinking they are real questions, so physicists, starting with Ernst Mach, developed positivism to deal with them.\nPositivism says, whenever you ask a question, ask yourself the following:\n\nAssuming the answer is this ot that, is there any effect on empirical observation? Do any sensory impressions change depending on the answer?\nDoes any chain of reasoning depend on the assumption of the answer? Can this reasoning always be translated to another assumption?\n\nIf the answer is no and yes respectively, then the question is meaningless.\nThe principle of positivism moots many questions, including that of \"existence\". If I have an cup, and it keeps all its attributes (visibility, water-holding, hardness,etc) but loses the property of \"existence\", how does it change? It obviously doesn't. So I can imagine that the cup is winking in and out of existence, and this does nothing to the empirical relations, so it does nothing at all to sense impression, and the question of existence is meaningless.\nCarnap noted that the positivism has the effect of culling away many traditional philosophical questions:\n\nIf the world is deterministic, how can we have free will?\nWhere did the universe come from?\nWhy is there something rather than nothing?\n\nThese and many others, essentially all of classical philosophy, are mooted or answered by applying logical positivist principles. This is codified in Carnap's book on the nonsensical nature of metaphysics. In the 1950s this was considered revolutionary, but by the 1970s, philosopers missed the old questions, so they quietly killed positivism and buried Carnap.\nThe notion of positivism is alive and well in physics, past quantum mecanics at least, but going back much further. The positivism is the source of all the influential philosophy and most of the influential physics of the 20th century, and it really is impossible to go back.\nYour question is meaningless in light of positivism, and has no answer, nor does it need an answer.\n"}]}

So if a person asks, \"why is fire hot?\" they are implicitly asking for a more detailed causal account of the heat of fire.  A reasonable response to this might explain that fire is the oxidisation of certain materials, and explain why this physical process produces heat; a deeper explanation might further explain heat and temperature in physics terms and give a more detailed account of what \"heat\" actually is.  One could ask an initial question like this, and then keep asking \"why\" at each explanation, and in each case, the respondent would attempt to provide a deeper account of the causal process, by going into more detail on the causal physical processes at work.  What is important here is that asking \"why\" is a question about causality, and the answer is always to give a more detailed causal explanation.\nSo, when you ask \"why is there something instead of nothing?\", you are asking for a deeper causal account of the creation of \"something\" (i.e., a causal account of the existence of existence).  This means that you are asking for a causal account for how \"something\" came to exist from a previous state that was not itself \"something\".  Which means: you are asking for a causal account of how \"something\" is created from \"nothing\".  Which means: you implicitly presume that something could not have been the start of things to begin with, and it must have sprung out of nothing.  By the very nature of \"something\" (i.e., existence) there is nothing else outside of it, and so there is no thing or time outside of it.  There is no preliminary state from which \"something\" could be the causal result.  Hence there can be no causal account of the existence of \"something\" and so there is no \"why\".\n(Incidentally, your question relates to a funny little experience that parents of young children have when little children incessantly ask \"why\".  Parents of young children will be familiar with the fact that there is a limit to one's explanatory capacity when the child keeps asking \"but why?\" at each step of an explanation.  This limitation represents the fact that deeper accounts of causality have a limit, though in the case of explaining things to a child this is more of a pedagogical limit than a metaphysical limit.  Nevertheless, you can see that eventually there must be a starting point.)\n"}]}

But its roots lie in the unresolved question of universals which dates back to Plato and Aristotle. See Problem of Universals on Wikipedia\nOne argument [given in answer to the question by @Saul] is:\n\".. if Nothing could be, then it would inevitably be Something - giving us a contradiction with our initial premises, thus demonstrating that Nothing cannot be.\"\nBut that has a whole bunch of issues about what kind of something, it seems on the face of it that it bootstraps Being, but really it just demonstrates the contradiction, not how the contradiction enables existence to be.\nMy understanding of the question is that the OP means how does it happen that we are here when so much is necessary to explain it? How does the Universe/Multiverse come about from an assumed earlier state of nothingness, or as an alternative to that state?\nIt is an expression of amazement, I think, and rightly so. And right up there with the top questions about us.\nMy answer is this:\nI say there is a state I will call virtual that is very similar to the ideal of universals.\nThe nature of the virtual is that something of it is inherent in any reality [Axiom 1], at least, where it is created as a consequence of relationships. Therefore, if we consider a situation where no thing is real, nothing, no material reality, no time, no space, no God, we can see that this would be a real state of affairs, if it were so it would be a real null. So it would also imply a virtual state of affairs as the ideal of nothingness, which is the same as a null relationship. This is the something which the reality of nothing forces into being. It is not much, just a virtual link between nothing and itself.\nIt would be a dead end, going nowhere, if it were not for the second axiom concerning the virtual.\nThe other nature of the virtual is that whatever is logically implicit in one state [instance] of the virtual necessarily follows on from that state. [Axiom 2]\nFrom axiom 2 we automatically, and necessarily, get the virtual state [predicate] of being. This virtual state is a relationship between the spirit [meaning/essence] of nothingness and the spirit [meaning/essence] of being. This is the first non-null relationship, but it is not a concrete thing, it is a virtual, abstract, thing, that exists nowhere and at no time. \nThat might not be perfectly argued, but the gist of it is, I think, valid.\nThe implications of this are many, but there are then even more steps to arrive at material existence. Which might include:  \n1) Number is a clear virtual consequence, and I imagine is still counting toward infinity, without being any closer, and in doing so provides a tick that is one measure of absolute time.\n2) Dimension is a natural consequence of number, and so another virtual feature of existence, one that creates a multi-dimensional void.\n3) Virtual time is only one thing happening after another, so having happened they remain, which is eternal.\n4) Godel's Incompleteness Theorem suggests some things are unanswerable by mathematics alone, so there is a need for something like a universe to try things out and see what happens. \n5) Consciousness could be in the relationships between the contents of mind, making it a virtual quality, rather than a physical quality of concrete brains.\n6) The Big Bang takes place in the multi-dimensional void, creating a 3d Universe that expands as the surface with a common radius from ground zero. That surface is always now, and holds all the matter/energy. Consequentially yesterday is gone, and tomorrow not happened.\n7) Material time is actually absolute, so all Relativity is about rate changing, not time. (space and time not really interchangeable, and no time travel)\n8) Quantum effects are not interpretable as a block universe, but require something akin to the Transactional Interpretation to explain Young's Slits.\n9) Other weird stuff happens, not yet accounted for by mainstream science.\n10) Maybe death is not the end, except for our bodies.\nSo there you go. Maybe it is not all exactly correct, or is heretical in places, but that is the joy of asking questions, especially impossible ones!\nPS. I am in no way qualified to claim any of the foregoing.\n"}]}

It is a conceptual truth (or, so to speak, true by definition) that God is a \n   being than which none greater can be imagined (that is, the greatest possible \n   being that can be imagined).\n2. God exists as an idea in the mind.\n3. A being that exists as an idea in the mind and in reality is, other things \n   being equal, greater than a being that exists only as an idea in the mind.\n4. Thus, if God exists only as an idea in the mind, then we can imagine \n   something that is greater than \u03a9 (that is, a greatest possible being that \n   does exist).\n5. But we cannot imagine something that is greater than God (for it is a \n   contradiction to suppose that we can imagine a being greater than the \n   greatest possible being that can be imagined.)\n6. Therefore, God exists.\n\nLet us now look at the framework of the argument and for notation we shall use \u03a9 in \nplacee of God. \n1. It is a conceptual truth (or, so to speak, true by definition) that \u03a9 is a \n   being than which none greater can be imagined (that is, the greatest possible \n   being that can be imagined).\n2. \u03a9 exists as an idea in the mind.\n3. A being that exists as an idea in the mind and in reality is, other things \n   being equal, greater than a being that exists only as an idea in the mind.\n4. Thus, if \u03a9 exists only as an idea in the mind, then we can imagine \n   something that is greater than \u03a9 (that is, a greatest possible being that \n   does exist).\n5. But we cannot imagine something that is greater than \u03a9 (for it is a \n   contradiction to suppose that we can imagine a being greater than the \n   greatest possible being that can be imagined.)\n6. Therefore, \u03a9 exists.\n\nThen a natural question follows, what is  \u03a9? Part of the problem that lies is the semantics in which it is cloaked. Gaunilo the monk argued by same line of \nreasoning that Lost Island exists substituting that term for \u03a9:\nGaunilo's argument runs along the same lines:\n1. The Lost Island is that than which no greater can be conceived.\n2. It is greater to exist in reality than merely as an idea.\n3. If the Lost Island does not exist, one can conceive of an even greater \n   island, *id est* one that does exist.\n4. Therefore, the Lost Island exists in reality.\n\nThe faulty reasoning becomes apparent when we generalize the argument, substituting either a concept of Non-Being, Non-God, Nothing or Anti-God (if you will). We shall use the notation !\u03a9. Does the argument still remain valid if we proceed in the opposite direction?\n 1. !\u03a9 is that than which no greater can be conceived.\n 2. It is greater to exist in reality than merely as an idea.\n 3. If !\u03a9 does not exist, one can conceive of an even greater !\u03a9, \n    one that does exist.\n 4. Therefore, !\u03a9 exists in reality.\n\nBut by definition of \"Non-Being\" !\u03a9 does not exist, yet we are asserting it does hence giving us a contradiction. Non-Being ipso facto does not exist if we take the premise that \"existence is part of essence\". One could also plug in the abstract concept of Nothing but that runs the danger of solipsism from linguistic abuse (ie bearing in mind when we state \"Nothing\" is that than which no greater can be conceived we agree that we cannot head in the opposite direction to conceive of, say, Ultra-Nothing or Meta-Nothing). Note: we do not interpret Nothing to be zero,] as one can always consider 0 plus an integer to counter the argument. \nWe can conclude that the fault lies in the not being able to manufacture a well-defined definition for the term greater or stems from taking Deity of Judeo-Christian background, and, St Anselm being an Archbishop, possibly, did not consider the dual of God (as in the argument above where loosely Zen philosophy was utilized of an idea of Non-Being).\nAs a side-note, I mention that we discussed it in college and our professor argued against the idea of being able to plug anything for \u03a9 because of the meaning of greater. If we do so we need to come to an agreement of the meaning of greater than and thus the problem does not go away for the notions of Non-Being or Non-Existence.\nRoughly, It is akin to visualizing God at top of peak of mountain or \"upward light cone\" and Nothing can be greater than Him. However, we can always conceive of a valley or \"downward light cone\" where at the very bottom resides Devil or Anti-Christ or the concept of Non-Existence. If we acknowledge St. Anselm's argument than there is nothing that prevents us from imagining something that is infinitesimal or dual to infinite nature of God.\n"}]}

Skeptically of course we don't -know-, but we see in ourselves that we have say a pain and we react a certain way (crying out or wanting to or the memory of such when younger) and we guess (usually successfully) that if we see that in others then they must also be feeling that way, and also the converse, if we don't see crying then we expect that they are not in pain.\nOf course, from experience we have all found (I surmise from seeing others) that life is not so simple: that the converse of material implication (the converse of 'P implies Q' is 'Q implies P') does not match the truth of the original, that pain and pleasure is not black and white, that people hide their feelings, that our senses are not always so accurate, that our judgements can be clouded by so many things, etc, etc, etc.\nSo we can look at a baby eating and probably infer that if they're feeding, what ever it is they're eating is less repulsive than the limit needed to stop them. It could be suffering at the taste, but not enough to want to suffer at the lack of food.\nJudging inner states of animals is so much harder because we can't so easily recognize similarities between ourselves and them.

Whether DV is a defendable claim is debated in current epistemology, as well as in philosophy of religion and, a bit more surprisingly, in philosophy of science. \nThe consensus seems to be that DV is untenable and thus doxastic involuntarism is the standard position. This shows in the use of the technical term, which is employed \u2013 in a similar way to \"relativism\" and other fighting words \u2013 as ultimate objections in arguments (\"Position X implies DV and is therefore untenable\").\nInterestingly enough, it seems that in the history of philosophy the situation was actually reversed, as DV was maintained by many central figures in philosophy (Thomas Aquinas, Descartes, Locke, ...). Although a minority position these days, there are quite important names who defended (some forms of) DV. Among them are Roderick Chisholm, Jerry Fodor and Bas Van Fraassen. Particularly the latter draws heavily from the pragmatist's toolbox, which was  arguably the only tradition where DV was more or less accepted.\n2) Regarding your question: \n\nIs it possible to choose to believe something one finds absurd?\n\nThe same question arises whether one can choose to believe a claim that she agrees rationally to be false. The problem is that a pragmatic justification of beliefs (i.e. based on utility and means-ends arguments) may clash with a (lack of) epistemic justification. Consider the following: \nP is false. However, believing that P has a practical advantage. Therefore one should believe that P.\nIt is hard to imagine that the pragmatic justification might override the belief that P is false. The debate whether this epistemic self-deception may be possible is one of the crucial topics in current debates around DV. (Again, the consensus is that it is not and thus is an objection to DV.)\nNow, consider:\nP is probably false. However, believing that P has a great practical advantage. Therefore one should believe that P.\nDoes this change your evaluation that overriding is possible? Probably not. However, in general it may be possible to construct a case such that the epistemic justification is weaken so much (and the pragmatic justification is strong enough) to produce a tradeoff where an override is possible.\nTo show another route, consider a more concrete example (presupposing that pessimistic meta-induction is a sound argument):\nOur best currently available scientific theory T is probably false. However, believing that T is probably false (and thus adopting an instrumentalist attitude) diminishes the empirical testability of T, while believing that T is probably true increases the empirical testability of T. Scientist consider the empirical testability of T to be crucial. Therefore, scientists should believe that T is probably true.\nWhat do you think now? Making the practical advantage to matter epistemically, seems to kinda blur the line here. In general, making these abstract schemata more concrete could show that there are contexts in which DV might be more plausible than in others, thus pointing to the context-sensitivity of DV.\n3) Regarding Pascal's wager:\nPascal's famous argument is used as textbook example of DV, but it is unclear whether Pascal actually presupposed DV in his argument. If I recall correctly, he didn't claim that such form of practical reasoning could lead to a voluntary belief in God, but that it could lead to take part in the religious practice, which in turn would create an environment where a belief in God could grow eventually. \n\n\nFor a more systematic introduction to the arguments adduced in favor and against DV this encyclopedic entry will get you started.\nHere is a link to current literature discussing DV.\n\n"}]}

People usually answer \"knowledge\" but then go for wealth throughout their lives. Everyone know lying is wrong, but how many of us has never lied before and will never lie after? Then can we say we deeply believe that lying is wrong?\nTo put it another way, we earn our knowledge from many different ways and sources.

No, the stipulative definition of the logical 'there exists' (used in mathematics or in ordinary discourse) says that there is at least one. In order to state that there exists exactly one, you need to specify additionally the 'exactly' part, or also say there is at most one.\nAs to your primary concern, I think there is overlapping but not identical use of the word 'exists' for numbers (like '1') and other things (e.g. friends, a verifiable theory, an afterlife, other minds, an apple in front us). Surely it is very immediate to say that 1 apple exists if it is sitting in front of us. But what does it really mean to say that '1' (oneness) exists? Does it exist in the same way as the single apple itself? What about negative 1? When the notation was introduced in Europe, there was quite a bit of controversy whether 1 was actually a number, and then later 0 itself and later negative numbers and complex numbers. But people got past all that (it is still a bit of a controversy whether one 'has' a negative number of apples).\nAnyway, numbers are (ahem) one way of describing sets. Suppose the set 'exists' by one standard of existence. Then certainly the ability to describe sets using numbers comes with the ability to talk about sets at all which is a different thing than the circumstances of that particular set's existence. So in that sense, the existence of 1 (and other numbers) comes before your particular claim of existence. \nExecutive summary: Yes, '1' comes first (or rather together with the machinery of mathematical existence).\n"}]}

It is not a material thing however and instead immaterial. It is an \"idea\" of sorts, but one that exists nonetheless. Of course it all depends on what we mean by existence of course, but it would be best to apply it in it's broadest sense. In this broad sense clearly, 1 exists. An example of something that doesn't exist or rather and even more strongly, couldn't exist, is 'nothing'. Nothing cannot exist. Nothing, while like 1, being an idea, would still be something, namely an idea. Likewise if 'nothing' did exist somewhere etc. then it would be something and no longer 'nothing'. Some say the set of nothing or the null set would show nothing existing, however that is still a set and not a proper referant of nothing. Remember that nothing has no referant. Simply put you couldn't even think of nothing, you would fail to do so, and further you would fail to be DOING nothing, because you would be engaging in a thought process, namely thinking of nothing. All in all, nothing could not exist, BUT MOST ASSUREDLY NUMBERS EXIST. After all, life and everything for that matter is dictated by physics, and well there's math and numbers involved in that. Similarly math and numbers are real because they are not, as some like to believe, man made or arbitrary. We may NAME them differently or CALL them different names like one and uno or even the symbol 1 and I (roman numeral) however the idea is always the same, the meaning is always the same, 1. So, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and even 0 exist, and also don't think 0 is nothing, while it is the symbol for the idea of nothing, it itself is a thing and there is no true referant for nothing, because then it would fail to be nothing and be a thing.\n"}]}

The doctrine is both metaphysical and methodological.\nMetaphysically, logical atomism employs the method of logical analysis to discern the fundamental objects (the logical atoms) from which complex (atomic or molecular) statements are constructed and things are constituted. Traditionally, these atoms are non-inferentially known sensa. Methodologically, logical atomism proceeds by reducing complex statements into simple components (the logical atoms) in logical relations under the assumption that there exists a direct correspondence between logical language and the constitution of reality.\nTo Russell, there are two types of atoms. On the logical side, there are names and predicates. On the metaphysical side, there are particulars and properties. Simple names are demonstrative, denoting simple objects; simple predicates are properties, denoting qualities or sensa. The atoms are used to form complex propositions or objects. For instance, in atomic propositions a property or relation is predicated of names denoting one or more atoms. Complex propositions are formed via truth-functions, quantifiers and atomic propositions or other statements.\nThe doctrine of analysis was popular in analytic philosophy from Russell to the early Wittgenstein, primarily as a reaction to British Hegelianism and under the influence of recent successes in mathematical logic. Later analytic philosophers such as Wittgenstein (Philosophical Investigations), Quine (Two Dogmas of Empiricism) and Sellars (Empricism and the Philosophy of Mind) successfully attacked the fundamental epistemological assumptions underlying it. In this regard, it is not a useful method for doing philosophy, and is distinct from the method of conceptual analysis found in modern analytic philosophy. The SEP has a detailed article.\n"}]}

Consequently, determinate being is conceived as being that is coextensive with and indistinguishable from non-being. This minimal specification of determinate being does not supply the concepts necessary for applying predicates to sensible objects or intuiting the essences of sensible or intellectual objects.\nBecause being and non-being are coextensive in determinate being, determinate being must be conceived as both being that is non-being (i.e., is determinate), and determinacy (i.e., non-being) that is. Insofar as quality is existent determinateness, it is determinateness that is or entertains being. However, quality is therefore being that is determinate. For this reason, quality is identical with determinate being. In other words, the what of being is determinate being or being that is determinate. The determinations of reality and negation in quality further develop the moments of being and non-being in determinate being, and provide the concepts necessary to think determinate difference.\nThe development of quality into its determinations of reality and negation shows that quality has a richer internal logic.

Yet after all, who is to say our desires are analogous to whatever moves/motivates God himself? And why should we suppose we would have any chance of understanding the mind of God in this or any respect?\nIn passing, I might also suggest another interesting question to explore might be: why should we assume creation itself has a purpose or meaning, even to God? More pointedly, perhaps -- granting that Creation did stem from certain \"motivations\" -- how much more complex and intricate (and possibly beyond the reach of our understanding) must God's motivations for creating the universe be than even the most complex and profound of human motives?\nIt seems the only chance we might have here to truly provide an answer would be direct revelation. Many religions explicitly invoke the limits of the capacity of our minds to truly understand Creation or it's meaning, more or less along the lines I am suggesting above -- that God transcends human understanding. Hence, at least for some, the answer is simply that: we are incapable of really knowing, though I can see why this might be somewhat unsatisfying. (Other sorts of faith traditions, as you suggest, supply various stories explicating God's motivations.)\nInterestingly, there seems to be a split among physicists on this issue. Many are on the side of \"no, there is no purpose\" or \"it is unlikely there is a purpose\"; their critiques stem from many places, including a critique on the basis of a lack of analogy between the human concept of purpose and the forces driving the universe, as well as critiques based on the intellectual uncleanliness involved in a creator hypothesis, which does not really seem to explain or predict very much. (On the other hand, some physicists draw conclusions in the other direction, convinced by their studies that a purpose is driving the universe.)\nFrom another angle, we may contrast the scientific and theological kinds of answers to this question with a very different sort of answer. Consider the early metaphysics of the young Nietzsche, who writes in The Birth of Tragedy (38) (my emphasis):\n\nonly as aesthetic phenomenon are existence and the world justified\n\n"}]}

Otherwise, one would put himself in the dubious position of assuming that the appeal to non-existence somehow explains existence. (The trend in philosophy since Plato, and perhaps long before him, is to posit some form of consciousness as the \u201canswer\u201d to such questions, even though this tactic is irrescindably incoherent.)\nThus, by posing this question and assuming that it is valid, you implicitly (but unavoidably) commits yourself to the fallacy of the stolen concept. If we ask why something is, but simply turn around and posit that something in our explanation of that something, what mileage have we gained? Indeed, we\u2019re back to where we started, yet we don\u2019t admit it to ourselves. This is what you do in assuming that the question \u201cWhy is there something rather than nothing?\u201d (or \u201cWhy does existence exist?\u201d) is a valid question. One will have to assume the fact of existence in order to answer the question. But in so doing, he will have to deny the fact of existence in order to validate his assumption that there must be a reason why there is something rather than nothing. He must assume the very concept his argument wants to deny, thus \u2018stealing\u2019 it from the objective hierarchy of knowledge, and rendering invalid any conclusion he hopes to draw from his argument.\nExistence exists. We must start somewhere. The theist wants to start with a form of consciousness. He wants to posit a mind (albeit supernatural) which is responsible for creating all its objects. This is called metaphysical subjectivism, a view which holds that existence finds its source in a form of consciousness.\nSome may object to my characterization of the question \u201cWhy is there something rather than nothing?\u201d as fallacious, contesting that there is no such thing as a fallacious question. However, it is true when we examine issues in epistemology and logic, that there is a such thing as an invalid question. The fallacy known as \u2018complex question\u2018, for instance, is a species of invalid question. It is a question which operates on a false assumption and expects the reader to accept that false assumption in order to answer it. The typical example is the question \u201cHave you stopped beating your wife?\u201d The question assumes that one is a married man and that he beats or has beaten his wife; indeed, it implies such beatings are a regular occurrence. Contrary to these assumptions, however, it could be the case a) that he is not married, or b) that he is married but has never beaten his wife. Since the question is asked in a manner in which a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 response can be the only appropriate reply, one cannot answer it on its own terms and avoid affirming its erroneous premises. One would implicate himself simply by answering. The question is fallacious because it leads one to accept a false premise, assuming either a) or b) are the actual case, if he should choose to take it seriously.\nLikewise, a question which leads one to commit a fallacy in order to answer it is also invalid. If taken seriously, the question \u201cWhy is there something rather than nothing?\u201d will lead one to commit the fallacy of the stolen concept; indeed, the fallacy of the stolen concept is unavoidable on the question\u2019s own terms, as we saw above. One would have both to assume and deny existence in order to address the question. If Martin Heidegger ,who originally asked this question, did not recognize this, it was principally because he was not operating on a fully rational philosophy. Yet, today we have theists assuming this question is valid all the time in the construction of their apologetic ruses. What is it that theists want to posit in response to their invalid questions so as to appear to satisfy them? Of course, they assume that the only logical answer is to assert a universe-creating, reality-ruling form of consciousness, which they call God, and delight themselves with this as their answer, never allowing themselves to recognize that the question leads them to accepting a stolen concept, and assuming that their arguments justifying this illicit move make it valid.\n"}]}

A few quotes to illustrate.\nPlato\n\nPlato was one of the earliest, most influential philosophers to\n  date\u2014mostly for realism about the existence of universals. In the\n  Theory of Forms, universals do not physically exist, like objects, but\n  as ghostly, heavenly forms. In The Republic, the Socrates character's\n  dialogue describes the Form of the Good. The Idea of the Good is ekgonos\n  (offspring) of the Good, the ideal, perfect nature of goodness, hence an\n  absolute measure of justice.\n\nEnlightenment philosophy\n\nThe Enlightenment and the colonial era both changed the nature of\n  European philosophy and exported it worldwide. Devotion and\n  subservience to God were largely replaced by notions of inalienable\n  natural rights and the potentialities of reason, and universal ideals\n  of love and compassion gave way to civic notions of freedom, equality,\n  and citizenship. The meaning of life changed as well, focusing less on\n  humankind's relationship to God and more on the relationship between\n  individuals and their society. This era is filled with theories that\n  equate meaningful existence with the social order.\n\nClassical liberalism\n\nClassical liberalism is a set of ideas that arose in the 17th and 18th\n  centuries, out of conflicts between a growing, wealthy, propertied\n  class and the established aristocratic and religious orders that\n  dominated Europe. Liberalism cast humans as beings with inalienable\n  natural rights (including the right to retain the wealth generated by\n  one's own work), and sought out means to balance rights across\n  society. Broadly speaking, it considers individual liberty to be the\n  most important goal,[27] because only through ensured liberty are the\n  other inherent rights protected.\n\nKantianism\n\nKantianism is a philosophy based on the ethical, epistemological, and\n  metaphysical works of Immanuel Kant. Kant is known for his\n  deontological theory where there is a single moral obligation, the\n  \"Categorical Imperative\", derived from the concept of duty. Kantians\n  believe all actions are performed in accordance with some underlying\n  maxim or principle, and for actions to be ethical, they must adhere to\n  the categorical imperative.\n\nUtilitarianism\n\nThe origins of utilitarianism can be traced back as far as Epicurus,\n  but, as a school of thought, it is credited to Jeremy Bentham,[28] who\n  found that \"nature has placed mankind under the governance of two\n  sovereign masters, pain and pleasure\", then, from that moral insight,\n  deriving the Rule of Utility: \"that the good is whatever brings the\n  greatest happiness to the greatest number of people\". He defined the\n  meaning of life as the \"greatest happiness principle\".\n\nNihilism\n\nNihilism suggests that life is without objective meaning. Friedrich\n  Nietzsche characterized nihilism as emptying the world, and especially\n  human existence, of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, and\n  essential value; succinctly, nihilism is the process of \"the devaluing\n  of the highest values\".[30] Seeing the nihilist as a natural result of\n  the idea that God is dead, and insisting it was something to overcome,\n  his questioning of the nihilist's life-negating values returned\n  meaning to the Earth.[31]\n\nPragmatism\n\nPragmatism, originated in the late-19th-century U.S., to concern\n  itself (mostly) with truth, positing that \"only in struggling with the\n  environment\" do data, and derived theories, have meaning, and that\n  consequences, like utility and practicality, are also components of\n  truth. Moreover, pragmatism posits that anything useful and practical\n  is not always true, arguing that what most contributes to the most\n  human good in the long course is true. In practice, theoretical claims\n  must be practically verifiable, i.e. one should be able to predict and\n  test claims, and, that, ultimately, the needs of mankind should guide\n  human intellectual inquiry.\n\nExistentialism\n\nEach man and each woman creates the essence (meaning) of his and her\n  life; life is not determined by a supernatural god or an earthly\n  authority, one is free. As such, one's ethical prime directives are\n  action, freedom, and decision, thus, existentialism opposes\n  rationalism and positivism. In seeking meaning to life, the\n  existentialist looks to where people find meaning in life, in course\n  of which using only reason as a source of meaning is insufficient; the\n  insufficiency gives rise to the emotions of anxiety and dread, felt in\n  facing one's radical freedom, and the concomitant awareness of death.\n  To the existentialist, existence precedes essence; the (essence) of\n  one's life arises only after one comes to existence.\n\nAbsurdism\n\nIn absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental\n  disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the\n  apparent meaninglessness of the universe. As beings looking for\n  meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving\n  the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their\n  works, The Sickness Unto Death (1849) and The Myth of Sisyphus (1942):\nSuicide (or, \"escaping existence\"): a solution in which a person\n  simply ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the\n  viability of this option. Religious belief in a transcendent realm or\n  being: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality\n  that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard\n  stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires a\n  non-rational but perhaps necessary religious acceptance in such an\n  intangible and empirically unprovable thing (now commonly referred to\n  as a \"leap of faith\"). However, Camus regarded this solution as\n  \"philosophical suicide\".\n\nSecular humanism\n\nPer secular humanism, the human race came to be by reproducing in a\n  progression of unguided evolution as an integral part of nature, which\n  is self-existing.[42][43] Knowledge does not come from supernatural\n  sources, but from human observation, experimentation, and rational\n  analysis (the scientific method): the nature of the universe is what\n  people discern it to be.[42] Likewise, \"values and realities\" are\n  determined \"by means of intelligent inquiry\"[42] and \"are derived from\n  human need and interest as tested by experience\", that is, by critical\n  intelligence.[44][45] \"As far as we know, the total personality is [a\n  function] of the biological organism transacting in a social and\n  cultural context.\"[43]\n\nLogical positivism\n\nLogical positivists ask: \"What is the meaning of life?\", \"What is the\n  meaning in asking?\"[48][49] and \"If there are no objective values,\n  then, is life meaningless?\"[50] Ludwig Wittgenstein and the logical\n  positivists said:[citation needed] \"Expressed in language, the\n  question is meaningless\"; because, in life the statement the \"meaning\n  of x\", usually denotes the consequences of x, or the significance of\n  x, or what is notable about x, etc., thus, when the meaning of life\n  concept equals \"x\", in the statement the \"meaning of x\", the statement\n  becomes recursive, and, therefore, nonsensical, or it might refer to\n  the fact that biological life is essential to having a meaning in\n  life.\n\nPostmodernism\n\nPostmodernist thought\u2014broadly speaking\u2014sees human nature as\n  constructed by language, or by structures and institutions of human\n  society. Unlike other forms of philosophy, postmodernism rarely seeks\n  out a priori or innate meanings in human existence, but instead\n  focuses on analyzing or critiquing given meanings in order to\n  rationalize or reconstruct them. Anything resembling a \"meaning of\n  life\", in postmodernist terms, can only be understood within a social\n  and linguistic framework, and must be pursued as an escape from the\n  power structures that are already embedded in all forms of speech and\n  interaction. As a rule, postmodernists see awareness of the\n  constraints of language as necessary to escaping those constraints,\n  but different theorists take different views on the nature of this\n  process: from radical reconstruction of meaning by individuals (as in\n  deconstructionism) to theories in which individuals are primarily\n  extensions of language and society, without real autonomy (as in\n  poststructuralism). In general, postmodernism seeks meaning by looking\n  at the underlying structures that create or impose meaning, rather\n  than the epiphenomenal appearances of the world.\n\nChristianity\n\nThough Christianity has its roots in Judaism, and shares much of the\n  latter faith's ontology, its central beliefs derive from the teachings\n  of Jesus Christ, as presented in the New Testament. Life's purpose in\n  Christianity is to seek divine salvation through the grace of God and\n  intercession of Christ. (cf. John 11:26) The New Testament speaks of\n  God wanting to have a relationship with humans both in this life and\n  the life to come, which can happen only if one's sins are forgiven\n  (John 3:16\u201321; 2 Peter 3:9).\nIn the Christian view, humankind was made in the Image of God and\n  perfect, but the Fall of Man caused the progeny of the first Parents\n  to inherit Original Sin. The sacrifice of Christ's passion, death and\n  resurrection provide the means for transcending that impure state\n  (Romans 6:23). The means for doing so varies between different groups\n  of Christians, but all rely on belief in Jesus, his work on the cross\n  and his resurrection as the fundamental starting point for a\n  relationship with God. Faith in God is found in Ephesians 2:8\u20139 \u2013\n  \"[8]For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of\n  yourselves, it is the gift of God; [9]not as a result of works, that\n  no one should boast.\" (New American Standard Bible; 1973). People are\n  justified by belief in the propitiatory sacrifice of Jesus' death on\n  the cross. The Gospel maintains that through this belief, the barrier\n  that sin has created between man and God is destroyed, and allows God\n  to change people and instill in them a new heart after His own will,\n  and the ability to do it. This is what the term reborn or saved almost\n  always refers to. This places Christianity in stark contrast to other\n  religions which claim that believers are justified with God through\n  adherence to guidelines or law given to us by God.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life\n"}]}

Earthly life is merely a test, determining one's afterlife, either in Jannat (Paradise) or in Jahannam (Hell).\nFor Allah's satisfaction, via the Qur'an, all Muslims must believe in God, his revelations, his angels, his messengers, and in the \"Day of Judgment\". The Qur'an describes the purpose of creation as follows: \"Blessed be he in whose hand is the kingdom, he is powerful over all things, who created death and life that he might examine which of you is best in deeds, and he is the almighty, the forgiving\" (Qur'an 67:1\u20132) and \"And I (All\u00e2h) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should be obedient (to Allah).\" (Qur'an 51:56). Obedience testifies to the oneness of God in his lordship, his names, and his attributes. Terrenal life is a test; how one acts (behaves) determines whether one's soul goes to Jannat (Heaven) or to Jahannam (Hell).\nThe Five Pillars of Islam are duties incumbent to every Muslim; they are: Shahadah (profession of faith); Salah (praying 5 times a day); Zakah (charity); Sawm (fasting during Ramadan), and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). They derive from the Quran & the Hadith, notably of Sahih Al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim.\n\nI want to add also that, It is beyond the reach of created things about fully understand it's creators plan.\nAnother point is : Allah created this universe for showing his mercy, power and incomparable correctness, and free from any inconsistency in artistic creation, so that all the created beings can understand his blessings over them.\nAs He said in the Holy Quran:\n\nYou do not see in the creation of the Most Merciful any inconsistency. So return [your] vision [to the sky]; do you see any breaks? [Al-Quran:67:3]\nand\nThen return [your] vision twice again. [Your] vision will return to you humbled while it is fatigued.

Why do He wants to be recognized, can He exist without this ? Well that's what he decided and surely he is not dependent in any way on what He creates. If there were any dependency, there won't be the attribute of being Omnipotent for God. He creates because he desires, not because He needs.\nThat recognition is in the form of worship. Again He doesn't need our worship (or that from Angels and other beings) to elevate His status or depend on it in any other way. The purpose of life (that includes animals and plants beside us) is to worship God and recognizing him as the ultimate creator of everything. \nSo what is our purpose in the universe ? Its the same, to worship and obey God. Why do we care ? Because if we do there is a prize at the end i.e. Heaven. If we don't there is punishment awaiting us i.e. Hell. How will our reward/punishment help Him ? It doesn't in any way. It helps only us when this worldly exam is over and we finally confront Him on the day of Judgement. If it were to help Him in any way, there would be a dependency and He won't be omnipotent any more.\nWhy the human race would be accountable among all His creation, why not animals and plants ? Human race in addition to its superior brain and intellectual abilities has been given a free will to choose between good and evil. To further harden this test of life, He has not proven himself to us in this world as a scientific law does. If He did, why won't we not believe in Him. After proving a fact to some one, would any sane person on this earth deny a recognized scientific fact? No he won't. Not knowing Him though absolute means give us the ability to disobey and divides people among believers and dis-believers.\nWouldn't it be nice if He could just show Himself to us so that there won't be any one skeptical of His existence. Well it would be but then there won't be any test for any of us. Why would any one ever disobey Him if he knew that he is going to live only around 60 years in this world while the life in Paradise/Hell would be for eternity. \nBut why do all of us are made to go through this test, how does all this helps God ? Because He desired and it doesn't help Him in any way, it only helps us :-)\n\n"}]}

If there's a god, so sure He will explain his will & rules & goals & outcomes of this life and what should we expect after. If we cannot see him everyday or anywhere -like my CEO :)- so sure He'll send a message or messenger to convey His words. Otherwise, He's just playing!!!

Sure He has a proper message and reason for this, otherwise he is not wise enough!

Only in religions, you can find that there's only One who says I came from nowhere and I created this life and here you are lots of evidences.

If this is my belief, I would do whatever I like to do regardless if it has purpose or benefit or not. If this massive universe doesn't have a purpose why should I?! Why should I care to do the right? and who dares to tell me what's right or wrong?! may be what you think is right, is wrong from my point of view? or at least I'm \"free\" I want to do the wrong things..

What does creationism vs evolutionism have to do with the 2nd part of your question? You are implying that if you have a creation, you must have a God. Second, that if you have evolution there is no God. Why cannot you have evolution and a God? You are also accepting a fallacy in the creationists argument. As described by Stephen Jay Gould (I think it was in either in one of 2 of his books, either Hens Teeth and Horses Toes, or Eight Little Piggies), that he says there is evolutionary fact and evolutionary theory. The creationists like to mix the 2 together evolutionary fact together with evolutionary theory. There is the fact that when we dig deeper and dig into older and older strata of rock, life becomes simpler and simpler. Then there is evolutionary theory, which is the explanation of these physical discoveries. \nFurther, these are artifical limitations. In the Hindu religion, no matter what the philosophical bent, monistic to dualistic, they all agree there is a God, and they all agree that there is no creation - the universe is projected out of God.

We see Reality, but mistake it for something which it is not. \nSecond, evolution was described in one of the early Hindu scriptures, in the Sankhya philosophy. Patanjali holds that the transformation of one species into another is effected by the \"in-filling of nature\" Evolutionary theory exists in some of the oldest recorded scriptures.\nFinally, Why did God create the universe? There is no concept of creation in Eastern philosophy. Creation is a Judeo-Christian concept. Eastern philosophy says that that what we see as the universe is a 'projection'. What we see as the universe is a projection of God. You can't create something out of nothing, there is no logic in that. To see the universe as it truly is - God - is what is meant by enlightenment. The projection always was and always will be - it has no beginning and no end. It is eternal. You were born in a human body and your senses have been bombarding your mind since birth that what you senses present to your mind is real. The illusion is eternal, to escape the illusion is what is meant by enlightenment - to become aware of your true nature. When you achieve this you see the world as God, not what your senses have been mistakenly seeing it as. Control the mind, cut off the senses.\nTo ask why God created the world or why there is a projection is not a question that can be posed outside the sensual world. There is no why. \"Why\" only exists in the world of time space and causation. God is beyond the sensual world of time space and causation. For God to have a 'why' implies that God has a purpose in the creation - or projection - of the world, for God to have a purpose implies that God is not perfect. The syntax of your sentence is correct - Why did God create the world? - but good syntax does not imply good logic.\n"}]}

We aren't the creation of Him, we are just a mere reaction or consequence of its creation (Big Bang), a side-effect.

Given that, a priori, it's very unlikely that anyone made that thing up, other explanations (even very improbable ones) begin to look correspondingly more favorable.\nSo it's entirely valid logically (albeit indirect via statistics).\nHowever, although it's potentially valid when doing statistical reasoning, it's not necessarily the case that people intend for you (or themselves) to do it that way.

The correct thing to do may be to recognize that although it's unlikely that someone could come up with such things, everything else is even more unlikely, and thus it-was-made-up is the best explanation (given available evidence).\nI'm not sure that a scenario this complicated is well captured by the terms logos, pathos, or ethos.  It is like ethos in that arguments from ethos are also arguments about weighting a priori probabilities in a Bayesian framework, but there is no trustworthiness involved here.  (Trust is one reason you might adjust your priors.)  Although there is logically sound information contained in such an argument, it is usually presented in a very different form than typical appeals to the intellect.

The notion was adapted from Charles Sanders Peirce, who includes the diagram among the icons in his index-icon-symbol model of the sign. Peirce identifies three types of icon: image, metaphor, and diagram. For him, the icon operates through a relation of resemblance between the sign and its referent. Guattari would agree that the image and the metaphor signify through resemblance, which is to say representation, but his version of the diagram functions differently because as he defines it, the diagram does not signify; it is \"a-signifying\"... Examples of the diagram at work include the algorithms of logic, algebra and topology; as well processes of recording, data storage, and computer processing; all of which are used in mathematics, science, technology and polyphonic music. Neither mathematics nor musical notation are languages -- rather, both bypass signification altogether...\nAlready in his notes for Anti-Oedipus, Guattari senses that Peirce's diagram is somehow special, that it unleashes \"deterritorialized polyvocity,\" that it must be understood as distinct from the image because the diagram is a site of production (AOP 72, 214, 243-255/97, 308, 346-349). He continues reflecting on the powerful, productive diagram in Revolution moleculaire [Molecular Revolution] and L'inconscient Machinique [The Machinic Unconscious], concluding that diagrams \"are no longer, strictly speaking, semiotic entities.\" Their \"purpose is not to denote or to image the morphemes of an already-constituted referent, but to produce them\" (IM 223, 224). In other words, diagrams do not represent thought; rather, they generate thought. Diagrams abound in experimental science, he says, because it is \"a sphere where signs have a direct effect on things,\" involving \"both material technology and a complex manipulation of sign machines\" (MR 166/RM 303). The diagrammatic consists precisely in this conjunction between deterritorialized signs and deterritorialized objects.\n\nWatson proceeds to demonstrate how Guattari on several occasions illuminates the notion of the diagram with the example of theoretical physics. The takeaway for me here was how the diagram functions 'outside of' language but nevertheless 'makes use' of signs. Watson formulates this point as follows (p. 13): 'This \"diagrammatic process\" makes use of signs, but not language, and therefore uses neither signifiers nor signification.'\nFinally, with regard to the drawings, Watson also notes that\n\nGuattari never claims that the drawings which illustrate his books are \"diagrams,\" according to his concept, but his drawings do figure heavily in his analytical writing. His drawings work like diagrams in the sense that they seem at times to generate ideas, as if they were operating on their own, like little machines.\n\nWatson also sheds some light on the relationship between schizoanalysis and cartography, and helps place it within a larger cultural-theoretical context:\n\n[Guattari] characterizes schizoanalysis not only as metamodeling, but also as map-making, a process of building \"a map of the unconscious--with its strata, lines of deterritorialization, and black holes.\" Guattari's emphasis on cartography (as for example in the title Cartographies schizoanalytiques) can be placed within a larger poststructuralist vogue of mapping which presupposes \"the unremitting deconstruction of representational thinking\" and therefore \"excludes a metaphysical definition of mapping the classical mimetic sense.\" Recognizing this rejection of representation and mimesis is crucial to understanding how Guatarri defines modeling, mapping and the diagram... Metamodeling can be understood as a very special form of map-making. It consists in making maps that are not content to merely illustrate, but which also create and produce.\n\n"}]}

It seems that this is something that has pestered him a lot, as almost every collection of his stories includes something on UFOs and psychics.\nHe talked about what it would take for him to believe in psychics (bear with me, I think it's relevant). Supposing there were a 'psychic' who claimed to be able to predict the outcome of things at a casino. So he went to a roulette table, and began to predict them, one by one. Suppose he got it 30 times in a row. Even then, Feynman said he would be completely skeptical. He would suspect collusion or some other trick first. But if he brought that 'psychic' to a variety of casinos, and he predicted it another 30 times at many different places, then he would believe. And he would be excited, because he hadn't expected it.\nThe idea is that everyone starts with an initial bias. And there are always lots of alternatives. Is it possible to show that something is a 'miracle' (whatever that means - in this context, I'm taking it to mean something whose explanation does not lie within our current body of knowledge) to a scientist (inasfar as he represents a rational thinker), but one would need to exhaust all other possibilities that seem more likely to him.\n"}]}

Contra the accepted answer, I see no reason why a person would be unable to enjoy (i-iii) and thus confirm (a-b) by doing (1-3).\nPerhaps the most unusual contribution this answer provides is the verification of a miracle, especially by (ii). This likely means observing more miracles, miracles which follow a pattern (purpose, or telos). For example, suppose a person starts hearing a voice which tells him the name of a person he will meet within the next twenty-four hours. It is logically possible that this 'voice' could be correct a large amount of the time. Neither the nature nor mechanism of this voice is required in order to hear it. After not too many data points, the hearer of the voice would be justified in claiming that he/she is witnessing 'miracles'.\nOne-off miracles are possible knowable; just consider a non-mathematician suddenly receiving a vision of the proof of some yet-unsolved conjecture in pure mathematics. The proof that the vision was received would be by verifying the mathematical proof. No mechanism would be known. This example is a bit difficult though, since we still know so very little about the brain.\n"}]}

Unfortunately, current research in physics indicates that things are a fair bit more complicated than that.\nSo, let's generalize: if the universe is comprised of a finite number of (otherwise) unchanging atomic elementary particles, and if a finite number of types of transformations are permitted to each particle, given the total state of all particles at one moment in time, one could theoretically derive a formula to derive the state for the next moment-- if, and only if, you believe that the transformations and operations thus described are determinate.\nIn other words, if there is any true randomness (and not merely pseudo-randomness) involved, you're shit-out-of-luck.

The latter is unknown to be possible. We can use a deterministic features of the macroscopic properties of objects in the universe (billiard balls or tinker toys) because theoretically a deterministic TM can compute the same things as a nondeterministic TM. \nCan a conceptual UTM simulate the universe? That depends on what we take the rules of physics to be. With Newtonian mechanics, deterministic atoms and chemical properties,and an initial state of all, I think so (but it will be quite intractable). Presumably all chemical , biological and psychological behavior would follow (the rules might be hard to extract though).\n\n\nNote: this isn't really an isomorphism but a bisimulation, which is really what you want (it's the equality of two kinds of mathematical processes rather than static mathematical objects).\n\nas to quantum machines, a lot of research (in computational complexity theory) has gone into showing that quantum machines can be simulated by classical machines (with an unknown overhead, possibly exponential, but also possibly only a constant, this is related to the P != NP problem). The inherent non-determinism of quantum mechanics might pose some difficulties with this simulation.\n\nBut non-technically, it is mostly a fascinating hypothesis to suggest that the universe is a computer. Mostly because it is just a way of thinking about physical rules. A physical law is conceptually the same as a copmutation (a computation of what it just did). Stephen Wolfram (the personality behind Mathematica and \"A New Kind of Science\") is a great proponent of this view (and he greatly emphasizes the 'is' part).\nAs to what follows from 'is' is that we should be able to do exact prediction (given enough time and space resources for the simulation) say of weather patterns. If 'is not', I still don't think it is of much difference. The limitations of time and space are roughly the same import as limitations of exactness.\n"}]}

If this universe contains undecidable propositions (like ours does), then no.  That would get you in a lot of trouble very quickly.

So you must rule out things such as the induction rule which is key to the TM to work if you really wanted to do this.

Therefore, there are uncountably many atoms in the universe (no, that's just a pun). It does no matter whether there is a countable or uncountable amount. The universe is isomorphic to a Turing Machine.\nWhy? As said above by danportin, the universe can only be isomorphic to the universe if there is an infinite number of things, as the tape is infinite (he also says the amount of states of a TM must be infinite, but that is false). We do, however, need a finite amount of input. If there is an infinite number of things, that can get quite tricky, but luckily it is a given that every thing is built from atoms (or the smallest known particles, I just stick with atoms).\nAs there is a finite number of atoms, we can proceed. The next important matter is the finite amount of states. To achieve the isomorphism there need to be only a finite amount of reactions possible between the atoms. Impossible, one might say, but remember that the infinite tape has nothing to do with the amount of states: We can just put all the possible outcome (may or may not be an infinite amount) on the tape, and only deal with the reactions between atoms in the states.\nThe amount of reactions (between atoms) is finite. The amount of possible actions in reading and writing is finite (go left, right, nowhere, write a finite set of tokens). Therefore, as a finite amount times a finite amount will lead to a finite amount, we have a finite amount of states in which we define the universe.\n(and remember kids, a TM is only defined by its states, not by the amount of tape it has)\nFor two, a quantum computer can only calculate a 2^n number of outcomes, therefore a finite number of outcomes, per tick. So, if the universe is neverending, we would need to let the quantum computer run endlessly before it can calculate the universe. Assuming we have the time for this, we can conclude there could exist a quantum computer isomorphic to the universe, but if you want an answer I suggest reading The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.\nFor three, I assumed the universe was built up from atoms. If this assumption is disproved somewhere the next aeons, then we need another kind of support to answer these questions.\nFor four: Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (again!).

To say that the indeterminate (seemingly random) state of a particle at the subatomic level grants human beings a method by which they can span the gap between the physical and the mental is nonsense. You couldn't even begin to make such a claim. Dualist theories of mind are flimsy for this very basic reason: there is an explanatory gap between how the physical interacts with the non-physical. Epiphenomenalism takes this to a whole new level: somehow not only does the interaction occur, but it can only go one way.

Upon this head I repeat what I have often had occasion to observe, that as we have no idea, that is not deriv\u2019d from an impression, we must find some impression, that gives rise to this idea of necessity, if we assert we have really such an idea. In order to this I consider, in what objects necessity is commonly suppos\u2019d to lie; and finding that it is always ascrib\u2019d to causes and effects, I turn my eye to two objects suppos\u2019d to be plac\u2019d in that relation; and examine them in all the situations, of which they are susceptible. I immediately perceive, that they are contiguous in time and place, and that the object we call cause precedes the other we call effect. In no one instance can I go any farther, nor is it possible for me to discover any third relation betwixt these objects. I therefore enlarge my view to comprehend several instances; where I find like objects always existing in like relations of contiguity and succession. At first sight this seems to serve but little to my purpose. The reflection on several instances only repeats the same objects; and therefore can never give rise to a new idea. But upon farther enquiry I find, that the repetition is not in every particular the same, but produces a new impression, and by that means the idea, which I at present examine. For after a frequent repetition, I find, that upon the appearance of one of the objects, the mind is determin\u2019d by custom to consider its usual attendant, and to consider it in a stronger light upon account of its relation to the first object. \u2018Tis this impression, then, or determination, which affords me the idea of necessity...
