Suppose that a sub-structure of my consciousness has the following sequence of states:\n\nBirth\n{... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...}\n{... 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ...}\n{... 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ...}\n{... 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ...}\nDeath\n\nPremise: I would argue that any universe that produces (either by computation or by chance) the above sub-structure would be producing my own conscience. At point 3, I would be remembering my childhood. At point 5, I would be dead.\nNow imagine that a specific universe produces the following:\n\nBirth\nLONG PAUSE\n{... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...}\nLONG PAUSE\n{... 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ...}\nLONG PAUSE\n{... 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ...}\nLONG PAUSE\n{... 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ...}\nDeath\n\nIf every state produces exactly the same sub-structure, then no matter how fast or slow these sub-structures are being produced, my conscience would still be \"experiencing\" the same as before.

Now, I can even mix all these states, and produce them out-of-order, but I would still be experiencing the same, from my point of view.\nTherefore, we have just excluded \"time\" as a requirement for an universe that sustains consciousness. We may still require \"time\" to explain the \"computation\" of states (i.e., why a state follows from a previous one), but, from the point of view of the observer, it doesn't matter.\nA similar exercise can be applied to space...\n"}]}

You can understand the abstract language and get little philosophical answering questions of users"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How to characterize Kant's usage of the term \"noumena\"?\n\nWikipedia gives an explanation of Kant's usage of the term noumena, part of which reads as follows:\n\nBy Kant's account, when we employ a concept to describe or categorize noumena (the objects of inquiry, investigation or analysis of the workings of the world), we are in fact employing a way of describing or categorizing phenomena (the observable manifestations of those objects of inquiry, investigation or analysis). Kant posited methods by which human beings make sense out of the interrelationships among phenomena: the concepts of the transcendental aesthetic, as well as that of the transcendental analytic, transcendental logic and transcendental deduction.[5][6][7] Taken together, Kant's \"categories of understanding\" are descriptions of the sum of human reasoning that can be brought to bear in attempting to understand the world in which we exist (that is, to understand, or attempt to understand, \"things in themselves\"). In each instance the word \"transcendental\" refers to the process that the human mind uses to increasingly understand or grasp the form of, and order among, phenomena. Kant asserts that to \"transcend\" a direct observation or experience is to use reason and classifications to strive to correlate with the phenomena that are observed. By Kant's view, humans can make sense out of phenomena in these various ways, but can never directly know the noumena, the \"things-in-themselves\", the actual objects and dynamics of the natural world. In other words, by Kant's Critique, our minds may attempt to correlate in useful ways, perhaps even closely accurate ways, with the structure and order of the various aspects of the universe, but cannot know these \"things-in-themselves\" (noumena) directly. Rather, we must infer the extent to which thoughts correspond with things-in-themselves by our observations of the manifestations of those things that can be sensed, that is, of phenomena.[8][9]\n\nI would like some help understanding this and in particular how to properly characterize Kant's usage of the term noumena. Some of my questions are as follows.\n\nDoes this mean that one can only know or deduce from phenomena?\nIs phenomena the \"same\" as that which appears to our senses? \nIs Kant using phenomena to define noumena? \nAre the terms \"subjective\" and \"objective\" relevant here? \n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since we can never think outside of our own minds, anything we ever think or perceive will inherently be subjective. \"Objectivity\" is and has only ever been just a form of collective subjectivity. The \"way things truly are\" may very well be vastly different than our human minds and senses can possibly perceive or comprehend. You should note, however, that Kant did think we could discern some objective truths about the nature of the universe, but only a very limited few (the Pure Categories of understanding, the reality of space/time/causation, etc). He is often seen as a bridge between rationalism and empiricism in this regard.\nUpdate: I wanted to add to my answer to also provide another refutation to the main concern that you seem to be having regarding existence as a predicate. You write:\n\nTo be is to be something instead of another thing. i.e. To be is to have attributes and characteristics. Noumena is that which is not accessible to observation. Kant claims to know that attribute about Noumena. If it is not accessible to observation how can he claim the attribute that it is not accessible to observation?\n\nThis is not actually true. The way you word it in this particular passage it's not entirely clear, but based on your other responses to me in more than one question on this site, it seems that you are insisting that existence is an attribute or characteristic, when in fact is it not. If I am to say that ice cream exists, I am not adding anything more to the concept of ice cream; it is not a \"characteristic\" of the ice cream. It is only a relation of the object (ice cream) to the subject (me).\nSee \"Existence\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence , although you will probably find more thorough literature on it under the arguments against the Ontological argument for the existence of God.  For example:\nhttp://www.existence-of-god.com/ontological-objections.html (section labelled \"Kant\u2019s Objection to the Ontological Argument: Existence is not a Predicate\")\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument#Kant:_existence_is_not_a_predicate\n"}]}

Although there are extreme views, such as Descartes' where \"the will is by its nature so free that it can never be constrained,\" most people accept that our will can at the very least be influenced by factors external to ourselves, if not wholly controlled by it. The challenge, as you point out, is finding how to explain a notion of freedom through non-causation. \nIn a strict sense, the answer to your question is no. There have been no successful logical explanations for free will as traditionally defined. The problem lies with the fact that to be free requires non-causation, or indeterminacy. Proponents of free will often invoke abstruse theories about the quantum indeterminacy or the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle as examples of where the secret of free will lies, but the major problem which undercuts each of these theories is a lack of an explanation of how free will can be obtained through seemingly random processes.\nConcordantly, I think it is more appropriate at this time\u2014given our current understanding of the universe\u2014to relax our notion of free will instead of trying to stretch it to afford an as of yet an indescribable freedom. To this end, the notion of free will in a deterministic system can be explained as an illusory sense of control that occurs when it appears there is more than one possible future before us.\n\n\nLong-winded explanation\nThe distinct feeling of freedom of action is not foreign to us, and even if we would call ourselves determinists we all still act under the assumption that we actually can control our own decisions and actions. We still talk and move around assuming our bodies operates under our own volition \u2013 if we did not we may as well simply collapse under the futility of it all. It is readily apparent that despite our understanding of determinism, our perceived control over our own actions completely permeates every moment of our lives \u2014 and thus the temptation to embrace free will. But closer inspection brings forth the actual degree of control we actually have, which is in my view broken into two distinct types of control: universal control and human control. Universal control is the notion that we are able, through whatever mechanisms, to break ourselves free of physical causation; this is impossible. In other words, it\u2019s just an affirmation of standard causal determinism: that \u201cevery event, including human cognition and behavior, decision and action, is causally determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences\u201d (Van Inwagen, 1983). This type of control we do not have. However, we do have human control; that is, we have the ability to predict (or rather, inability to perfectly predict)  the outcome of events which provides us with the illusion that there is a \u201cpossibility\u201d between choices. Note that it is not the freedom to \u201cdecide\u201d whether or not we predict or not; it is simply the distinct feeling of comfort and peace that comes from a sense of control, i.e., from one\u2019s sense that he or she understands the future well enough such that his or her desires are favorably in-line with the likely future. Stated differently, we do not have control in the sense that we are agents free from causation, but we do have control in the sense that, given our inability to calculate the precise outcome of all the causal factors leading to a particular event, we are able to\u2014with a fair degree of accuracy, especially for common events\u2014predict at least a set of outcomes that will likely occur. While only one outcome is truly inevitable for any event, our limited intellects can often only narrow down the factors to several \u201cpossible\u201d outcomes. The control we feel is the degree to which our predicted outcome is expected to match the inevitable outcome. Dennett (1984), illustrates this best with his remote-control airplane example:\n\nWhen you control your plane perfectly, you don\u2019t do it by controlling\n  all the causes that influence it. The weather, the density of the air,\n  and the force of gravity, for instance, are all beyond your control,\n  and they are the largest forces that act on your plane. The fact that\n  your plane is constantly under the influence of gravity does not\n  prevent you from controlling it\u2013in fact in some regards gravity helps\n  you, just so long as you know its effects on the plane. But a sudden\n  and unanticipated gust of wind may upset your control, either\n  temporarily or permanently. What is important about the difference\n  between the gust of wind and gravity is not the steadiness of the\n  latter and the suddenness of the former, but the (relative)\n  unexpectability of the former. \u2026 Foreknowledge is what permits\n  control.\n\n\u2013Dennett, Daniel (1984). Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Having. Cambridge. MA: MIT Press.\nThus, the nature of human control is not \u201creal\u201d control; it is the measure of our desires against our prediction of the future. At best, this leaves us with the illusion of free will. In this way (regarding the OP's question), free will can be quantified in a deterministic system without breaking any rules of causation.\nIn an effort to avoid some of the inevitable pro-\"free will\" comment backlash this post will generate, I just to want to add that I understand that people don't want to give up the idea of freedom of action; they don't want to be reduced purely physical automata. What they don't realize is that\u2014if this is the way we really are\u2014nothing really has to change. It's not like the slight alteration of our conceptual understanding of the free will flips our entire world upside down. At the end of the day, we still get up in the morning, we still take showers, eat breakfast and go to work. We still hang out with our friends when we want and watch our favorite TV shows as we please. Ice cream and brownies still taste delicious, the night sky full of stars still fills us with awe and wonder, and the pain of losing a loved one is still real to us. If determinism is true, no one has to give up anything.\n"}]}

I believe it is all contained in our brain and our mind is one and the same as our brain. However, lets consider a possibility that our complex brain has evolved higher order functions that include a \"choice engine\". The engine has evolved as it can give people a survival edge to act differently given the same environment. The engine is a set of complex interacting and self modifying algorithms obeying all the law of nature. The unique thing about the engine is that given any set of inputs it does not give the same answer every time and nor does it give a random answer. It's rules allow it to make a considered choice. At this point, I don't think we can construct such a machine, but that doesn't preclude its existence in our brains. \nHumans need to \"invent\" a \"choice engine\" in a super computer and demonstrate that it's choices are neither random nor pre-determined. In fact they will have to have two of them side by side and show that they produce differing results with the same input without randomness. \nThe other point worth mentioning is that if there is no free will and all is determined, we are still unlikely to ever be able to make accurate predictions beyond statistical probabilities (i.e. certainties) that will be useful. So where does one go with determinism, if we'll never be smart enough to pre-determine anything that is even slightly complex - say what direction will a microbe travel in a solution in a petri dish. Obviously, that doesn't change how \"true\" determinism is, but it also makes it a rather useless truth.\nI listened to an excellent radio podcast last week between 3 neuroscientists (BBC In our Time - Neuroscience).  They describe the brain in 3 sections, in increasing order of evolutionary development and from low to high function. The inner brain, nearest the spinal system, deals with motor functions and direct response to sensory input. This is the \"reptilian\" brain, dealing with simple stuff. It's the engine of a machine. No free will going on here, just survival impulse. The next layer is the \"mammalian\" brain that deals for more complex sensory input, interpretation, learning, emotions, etc. Sort of stuff that makes a chimpanzee so human in its behaviour. The last layer is the surface areas of the brain, uniquely human. Here is where the human high order functions happen. This is where \"planning\", sorting through large amounts of data and distilling this into strategies far more complex than \"man kill, man make fire, man eat\" - the most commonly given example is, what college shall I go to? \nIt's not a low order impulse driven decision. It's a high order, complex decision, based on many variables, where the variables themselves are not senses and are not definitive. Indeed, the variables will change - you might change your opinion based on your mood on a particular day. \nBecause of all of this complexity and variability, the decisions taken (\"free will?\") are not easily predicted not easily replicated. If they can't be predicted and replicated, then, even with deterministic physics at the ultimate root, this can be considered \"free will\" - at least its a candidate for free will.\nSo my \"newbie\" definition of free will is \"actions that cannot be predicted and are not random\". I suspect this is full of holes and tautology, but I like it for now. \n"}]}

Each time our ego is being threatened, then our domination is being threatened.\nAnd our ego have ability to push ourselves to dominate as far our own available functions (potential) that can be realized without obstacle.\nIf our ego are being threatened and this threat restricts our ego to release our functions as human, then ourselves will try to find something better to support our functions as human.\nIf our ego was failed to dominate, further our Id will not be satisfied, and we need another chance (freedom) to fulfill our needs\nThere must be better synchronizing in between our functionality as human and something to support ourselves. Without this, our domination will be threatened easily, and our ego will be threatened, further our freedom (to fulfill our needs) will be restricted.\n\nIt's freedom for our determination.\n\nPleaser refer to SuperEgo, Id and Ego for further understanding. I am not supporting exactly what Sigmund freud said, but part of his work has the closer principle as mine and it can be used as citation to make a clear understanding on this case. I have different point of view (Bending Consciousness) regarding on this.\nThe points are:\nWe can always trace back our current choices to previous events with limitations that dominate us and lead us to current decisions. Therefore, what does it mean to have freedom as a human?\n\nIt means to explore to the possible extent within our ability to make progress, as far as on whom we rely.\n\n\nThis can be expressed in two different ways (to provide necessary conditions for an action to be regarded as a free choice) within two different perspectives.\nThese are the closest ways (various degrees) to freedom:\n\nFrom fairness:\n\n\n\nOur ability to get supports to fulfill our functionality as human, to be specifically our own functionality that typical to ourselves,\nIt's fulfilling to the specific extent within fairness.\n\n\n\nFrom our ego:\n\n\n\nOur ability to satisfy our ego to dominate.\nIt's fulfilling such domination to satisfy our ego to create sense of freedom.\n\n\n\nBecause, there is no way for us to get freedom beyond any boundaries, since it's unreasonable. Whether we believe causalities or not, but no matter how hard we try to be free, we are still within boundaries.\n"}]}

With the exception of the concept of sense-data, which was abandoned by the Author in latter works, the rest of the book is still good. I hope it answers your question.\n\nThe apparent indeterminateness of the future, upon which some\n  advocates of free will rely, is merely a result of our ignorance. It\n  is plain that no desirable kind of free will can be dependent simply\n  upon our ignorance; for if that were the case, animals would be more\n  free than men, and savages than civilised people. Free will in any\n  valuable sense must be compatible with the fullest knowledge. Now,\n  quite apart from any assumption as to causality, it is obvious that\n  complete knowledge would embrace the future as well as the past. Our\n  knowledge of the past is not wholly based upon causal inferences, but\n  is partly derived from memory. It is a mere accident that we have no\n  memory of the future. We might\u2014as in the pretended visions of\n  seers\u2014see future events immediately, in the way in which we see past\n  events. They certainly will be what they will be, and are in this\n  sense just as determined as the past. If we saw future events in the\n  same immediate way in which we see past events, what kind of free will\n  would still be possible? Such a kind would be wholly independent of\n  determinism: it could not be contrary to even the most entirely\n  universal reign of causality. And such a kind must contain whatever is\n  worth having in free will, since it is impossible to believe that mere\n  ignorance can be the essential condition of any good thing. Let us\n  therefore imagine a set of beings who know the whole future with\n  absolute certainty, and let us ask ourselves whether they could have\n  anything that we should call free will.\nSuch beings as we are imagining would not have to wait for the event\n  in order to know what decision they were going to adopt on some future\n  occasion. They would know now what their volitions were going to be.\n  But would they have any reason to regret this knowledge? Surely not,\n  unless the foreseen volitions were in themselves regrettable. And it\n  is less likely that the foreseen volitions would be regrettable if the\n  steps which would lead to them were also foreseen. It is difficult not\n  to suppose that what is foreseen is fated, and must happen however\n  much it may be dreaded. But human actions are the outcome of desire,\n  and no foreseeing can be true unless it takes account of desire. A\n  foreseen volition will have to be one which does not become odious\n  through being foreseen. The beings we are imagining would easily come\n  to know the causal connections of volitions, and therefore their\n  volitions would be better calculated to satisfy their desires than\n  ours are. Since volitions are the outcome of desires, a prevision of\n  volitions contrary to desires could not be a true one. It must be\n  remembered that the supposed prevision would not create the future any\n  more than memory creates the past. We do not think we were necessarily\n  not free in the past, merely because we can now remember our past\n  volitions. Similarly, we might be free in the future, even if we could\n  now see what our future volitions were going to be. Freedom, in short,\n  in any valuable sense, demands only that our volitions shall be, as\n  they are, the result of our own desires, not of an outside force\n  compelling us to will what we would rather not will. Everything else\n  is confusion of thought, due to the feeling that knowledge compels the\n  happening of what it knows when this is future, though it is at once\n  obvious that knowledge has no such power in regard to the past. Free\n  will, therefore, is true in the only form which is important; and the\n  desire for other forms is a mere effect of insufficient analysis.\nRussell, Bertrand. Our Knowledge of the External World. George Allen & Unwin Ltd.: 1922\n\n"}]}

We don't know which of the number streams is the product of free will, which is the product of a determined process, and which is the product of chance.\nSecond: upon closer examination, we see that each of the three alternatives is actually problematic, even if we know which person is in which box.

Can we be certain that there is not a deterministic process that is controlling the brain chemistry and synapse-firing to cause certain numbers to be chosen?\nSo, where are we, then?\nWe are left with the sad fact that we have no means by which to provide a rigorous definition for any of the terms involved, and must rely purely on our intuitive sense of what they mean in context.\nFortunately, this is not really a problem, since the so-called problem of free will isn't really much of a problem, anyway.  It certainly appears to us that we have free will, and our actions are predicated on that belief.  If that belief is erroneous, precisely nothing changes in our actions-- it cannot, because if the belief is erroneous and our actions are determined, well, then they are determined and are what they would have been.

Because this is what 99% of people all around the world try to defend when they defend 'free-will'. I think other types of (scholarly defined) necessary conditions have to be thrown out since they don't correspond with what most people mean when they claim people have a 'free-will'.   \nLong Answer:\nI think the key in sorting out the free-will confusion is to separate 'choice' from 'free-choice' ('will' from 'free-will'). If you claim that you have free-choice you have to define what makes it different from choice. If you claim that we live in a non-deterministic universe you have to describe what you mean. Then you have to provide at least an example (an evidence) for this. \nWhen it comes to randomness and non-deterministic view points you will always be able to present things that seem random or non-deterministic until you understand all of the workings of the universe, which we will never do, and so you will always find evidence for this e.g. before Newton objects seem to move at random, before we found the atom things on that level seemed random, now quarks seem random, next something else will be proven to be random. Determinism (cause and effect) is like math; we just have to agree that all things (abstract things are not things in their own right since thoughts do not exist outside of our scull) can be explained through cause and effect until we find too many things not happening according to cause and effect, just like we just have to agree that 1 + 1 = 2 until too many people start adding up 1 pile of sand with another pile of sand and get confused over why they don't have two piles. Unless we agreed on how knowledge can exist (cause and effect and math being 2 of the most vital) are agreed upon we will get nowhere and have to believe that knowledge is impossible. \nWhen it comes to 'free-will' as oppose to 'will' I don't see how anyone has ever defined 'free-will' in a useful way as something different from 'will', and then shown an example of when this happened. To make it different you would have to make the necessary conditions of 'free-will' something similar to 'you can take an action unhindered and uninfluenced by current and past events' and try to present examples of when this happened. Because no one is arguing that we don't make choices; whether they are free or not they are still choices; choices which are either caused or not caused by something else. \nI think the reason for why you find so many people defining 'free-will' basically as 'sometimes we make choices' is cultural pressures. You don't become popular anywhere by talking away this long lasting concept that we base all our blame and credit ideas on; our legal system; our meritocracy. So it is easier for people to define it in a way that lets them say that they believe in 'free-will' so that they don't have to deal with the real consequences of the fact that every effect has one or more causes which ultimately can be understood (even if it is complex esp. all social sciences). \nI have been having the free-will - determinism debate at least once every week for over 10 years now and I can tell you that 99% of the people I have been talking to (I am well traveled; have constantly been moving around the whole globe over this time) defend 'free-will' by claiming that you can 'take an action unhindered and uninfluenced by current and past events'    \n"}]}

Unpredictability is an important criterion in cryptography, but does not work as a general criterion for itself, for it is too unclear. For example, if you record a sequence of random numbers (generated from radioactive decay) for later use, you may \"predict\" them before they are used, because you have already recorded them, yet they would still be random numbers. Vice versa, many deterministic processes can be unpredictable in practise. A slightly better practical definition of randomness is that a sequence of numbers is random if you cannot compress it and it satisfies some additional statistical criteria. (That practical measure is related to Kolmogorov complexity.) The problem is that a sequence of numbers might pass all these tests and still not be random, i.e. you cannot really tell from a sequence whether it is random or not by looking at the numbers alone. A random generator outputting characters may spit out all works of Shakespeare at any time, although this is highly unlikely.\nThird, non-determinism involves a random choice between alternatives.\nSo what does this have to do with free will? Since a random choice would not be a choice of your free will but rather a choice made by the respective random source, a choice made of free will does not seem to be the same as a non-deterministic choice. Since on the other hand we do not consider a deterministic choice to be a choice of free will either - perhaps not even a choice at all - the concept of free will might be inconsistent after all. In any case, without a proper definition of free will we cannot give an answer to your question, and if you had this definition you would likely have answered the question already for yourself.\nThere are two easy ways out of this dilemma: (1) Discard free will in the sense of accepting determinism. (2) Discard free will in the sense of accepting that free will  consists of highly complex, non-deterministic, yet rule-based choices.\nI personally opt for (2), because it is more in line with modern physics than (1) and supported by the view that human brains are open information processing systems. (Notice that a computational system with the ability of making non-deterministic choices is not a Turing machine, although it might be an extension of one.)\n"}]}

Also I'm not glad with basically all the definitions I've read here, except one - stoicfury's (read below). Also Karl's input (about the brain) is very insightful.\nContrary to Michael, I think definitions are very, very important. I'd argue it's fundamental for one's well being and it can lead a society to glory or doom.\nI once had too loose definitions of words and no religion. So I was often confused with what I should think, with what I should do. Hell, I still have this problem today, and I will probably have to live with it for ever. As I began to give proper definitions in my mind, I also enabled myself to move forward, set a direction to move in my life. It's not much different accepting a definition I created myself or accept one from religion, but I think having it defined is very important if you want to build anything in your life.\nAs for a society, giving words to concrete objects is easy. And it facilitates communication to do practical things. \"Pass me the hammer, please\". Similarly, giving words to abstract concepts can help we orient each other to better position each one of us in society and build it up. \"Should I get married?\". \"How many kids?\". Yes, \"kid\" is quite an abstract concept. And I think the facility we have to communicate about it today is in part responsible for how big our Earth society is, despite the babylon of different languages.\nSo, allow me to give you my own personal definitions in hope to bring some new perspective here. I'm pretty sure they go against some common definitions, such as ones we can see in wikipedia, but those are how I see the concepts they're associated with, based on my social intuitive sense. Of course you can choose to use different words to try and add different definitions, give different meanings. But I think the current meaning people give to those words are quite broken...\n\nUniverse = every single thing we can even imagine\n\nSome may perceive an idea / information / data as being something outside our reality. Dreams, for instance, can easily break rules of physics. Or can they? This is no simple concept and I won't digress about it here... Please, just take this definition and see if you can cope with it: there is nothing we can even think of that would be outside the universe. Not just the common concept associated with the \"observable universe\". There is no \"multiverse\". Everything is included. What exists, what doesn't exist and what might exist. If there is anything beyond the big bang that might affect us, it is within the universe. This is an important common ground definition I'll use for the other 3 you asked.\n\nFree will = ability to think\n\nI think free will has nothing to do with actions. I would say a restrained prisoner still have free will, even though he won't be able to do anything with it. A coma patient have no free will. Sure, thinking in itself can be considered work (i.e. an action), in a physical sense, as there are universe-embedded-neurons acting in our brains. And, as such, even our thoughts are restricted by the universe rules we live in. But, as long as we are able to rationalize anything, I call that free will. Maybe \"free will\" is just another word for \"intelligence\", after all. I love a definition I once saw for intelligence as \"capacity to predict the future\".\n\nRandomness = events which were unpredictable\n\nstoicfury's definition is spot on to me, just there's no need to say \"any outcome is equally probable\" as it is implied in the \"unpredictable\". To me \"random\" means \"unpredictable\". The moment some future event becomes predictable it is no longer random. If we live indeed in a deterministic universe (I think we do, but that's beyond the point), nothing is random by definition. Even then we can still perceive things as random while we can't predict them.\n\nNon-determinism = events with unpredictable outcomes\n\nWhat? So it's the same as random? Yeah, basically. A deterministic universe is a connected universe. If it originated from a single point in space time, the initial variables there and then have determined every single thing that will ever happen within it. Nothing in it is truly random. So a non-deterministic event is an event that will bring at least 1 random result. And indeterminism is just a prettier name for this same thing.\n\nConclusion . . .\n\nFree will has nothing to do with randomness or determinism. You say random means the choice is unpredictable, but how could it ever be unpredictable if there was just 1 option to begin with? You're confusing definitions there. Unpredictable implies more than 1 option, more than one possible choice. Randomness and determinism are different ways to look at the exact same thing.\nTo all that, Michael's 3 tiny people experiment still applies, and the conclusion is still the same. Today (and maybe for ever) we can't tell with certainty if our universe is deterministic or not. Even if we define the universe as a non-cyclical infinite space-time continuum it still could be either random or intrinsically predictable. And the foreseeable future indeed make it seem like it is practically irrelevant to have a precise definition for those concepts.\nAnd who's to say it really is irrelevant? So far, even if the universe is not random, we can't predict the future. I can only say, from past events, many definitions some philosophers did in the past are quite valuable today. I don't know why we like to argue about future concepts so much, but the value in defining all this may arise much sooner than we can expect. There is the very small chance we may live much longer to even see it happening. I don't think getting to a good and solid common definition is unimportant at all. Just the personal enjoyment of digressing about all those subjects are of quite enough value to me. Specially if I find someone who share the same view!\nIf our so called capacity of choice (often associated with \"free will\") is indeed an illusion, I find it very enjoyable how this deterministic universe can still uphold such a magnificent existential living experience. And finding a person who can agree, who got the same idea coming from a completely different point of view is kind of magical. It's probably the main reason why I go through so much trouble to write questions and answers here.\n"}]}

If not, what are alternate workable definitions?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A good question.\nThe defining property of free will, i.e. freedom in choices, is the \"feeling\" or consciousness of the own authorship of the choice being made. Even if/when I'm forced to comply I cannot escape the glimpse, at the moment, that nothing actually is selecting the way for me, except that \"foolish\" me (who is, actually, nobody/anonymous this minute) who agrees with the offered.\nThus, every human choice is a free choice, and responsibility is implied automatically. That would be Sartre's account.\nMoreover, even when I stumble and fall down, I immediately and promptly react and interpret the occasion (e.g. by the fear to break an arm and not be able to paint anymore through that). By application of a free interpretation/meaning I emerge responsible for my incident though I didn't choose to stumble. I selected to be thus fallen, instead.\nFreedom is spontaneous choice (of meaning and action) accompanied by the awareness of own authorship / resposibility. Or to put it differently, the apprehension that there is nobody/nothing specific is to blame except myself.\nThe key point here, @HWalters, is that ownership belongs to (is felt by) faceless me, the Nothing, and not to I, the Something. If nothing is the decision maker, the decision is, logically, not motivated by any preexisting structure, i.e. it is not determined (subjectively) by any cause. It is motivated by no cause, a pure gap in causational chain. (It is but later that we can attribute a cause to our decision, to \"excuse\" it.)\nThus, freedom is human (i.e. conscious) randomness (conditioned upon given circumstances). Within the scope of possible alternatives the circumstance can support, it is non-determined.\nA man is an entity whereby randomness becomes own while determinism gets broken. Whenever consciousness comes to play, whenever something comes to being through consciousness, determinism is canceled.\nEven conceived/planned decision without instant action is not your \"will\", it is spontaneous. It was spontaneous when it first occured to you, and it is again spontaneous when you start to act according to it: you re-invent it one more time, using your knowledge of the plan as the circumstance, and act.\nSo, free will is freedom. Specifically \"will\" is a redundant word, and people do not do things by \"will\" as some tension or effort. It is when I reflect back on the thing done or on the difficulty to overcome to do it, I might see that \"labour\" of my Ego involved and start to think of (free) \"will\" as my instrument. \"Will\" is always an artefact of reflection (\"I decided and did it myself\", \"I must decide to do it\"). No \"will\" is actually used in real, here-and-now decision makings.\nAlso to say: curiously, non-human (out there, universal) randomness is close, in eyes of a human, to determinism (or doom) and not to indeterminism. Both random and predetermined appear to us as contingency which is a characteristic of facticity to where we are \"abandoned\". Marooned for making free choices in the flight from facticity towards meaningful world.\nP.S. Once again, how I feel it, and in a response to a comment elsewhere, where they've just asked me how freedom is different from randomness:\nFreedom (free will) is spontaneous self-determination. Randomness is when the cause, \"author\", cannot be indicated, there is none such. Whereas here we have the cause - it is the prereflective, nonthetical self.\nThat self, being the cause of a choice, is also causa sui; it is not a consequence of another, so it is not a mediator for the choice, - that is because it is non-being: it is not based/founded on being, on what is.\nFurther, it (the self) is not a tuple pair (self & choice), but one monad: the self selects itself as one possibility of the object-in-the-world (this glass of water in front, which is so drinkable) and emerges in this act. The self thus generates itself and generates its choice in a single pass, one event. It does not pre-exist this functional act of choosing as something, but coincides with it as nothing. (Nothing is shortage of..., unclasping of..., not an emptiness.) I'm choosing myself as the possibility (or potentiality, or opportunity - don't know for now which word is better) of an object, me-possibility existing as deferred here, but strictly inside the circle of conditions (givennes, including my own empirical Ego) which I therefore appear beyond.\nSo, the causality with consciousness, or free will, is special: via self-nothingness rather than via being/matter. Spontaneity, aka free self-determinism.\n"}]}

I don't see how my uncertainty about the nature of the apple pies has any effect whatsoever on the actual possibility of the composition of the pies. Either the apple pies are made from handpicked apples, or they aren't. My uncertainty about it does not make either possibility more or less probable.\nKeep in mind my question is about the general ability to use a \"lack of knowledge\" claim to invalidate a positive claim. Determinism/apple pies are just examples. Feel free to use whatever thought experiment or intuition pump that serves you best.\nNote I wanted to avoid using the term \"negative claim\" because it's thrown around a lot and doesn't quite capture the essence of what I mean by a \"lack of knowledge\" claim; at least insofar as I see it being used today. E.G., some people think \"There is no flamingo on my desk\" is a negative claim, merely because it posits the non-existence of something. To me, anything which asserts a knowledge of the existence or non-existence of something is a positive claim. A \"lack of knowledge\" claim, on the other hand, is one which acknowledges an uncertainty or \"non-knowledge\" (if you will) of something.

Observation of apples has no significant effect on apples.\nThings are different at the quantum level, however.  Observation of particles has a definite effect on the particles.  Thus, any notion of determinism that relies upon the observability of particles has a problem, as the act of observing interferes with the experiment (and may alter what would have occurred had the observation not taken place.)

I think you're unintentionally mischaracterizing the arguments for non-determinism in quantum mechanics.\nLet's take one of very many weird results in quantum mechanics.  You have polarized sunglasses, right?  What happens with polarization is that a photon has one of two polarizations which are at 90 degrees to each other; if it is aligned with the sunglasses it can pass through, but if it is aligned at right angles, it can't.  If you line up two pairs of sunglasses, it's only as effective as one: the photons that were aligned with the first pair are still aligned and pass through both.  Now suppose you play a nasty trick on your photons: you rotate your second pair of sunglasses by 45 degrees.  Guess what happens?  Half the photons go through.  Half of them are aligned with the new sunglasses, and half are at right angles.  It's like the sunglasses made the photon choose: did you really secretly want to be 45 degrees to the left, or 45 degrees to the right, when you said you were vertical before?  And you can do this over and over and over and over.  If you have vertical sunglasses, then 45 degrees, then vertical again, the photon doesn't remember anything about its first \"choice\"; maybe it was a \"vertical, then 45 degree, then 90 degree\" photon, or maybe it was a \"vertical, then 45, then vertical again\" photon.\nAt some point, saying that the behavior is determined (but by nothing that we can measure, and even with a proof that there is (probably) not anything local we could measure) starts to be unwieldy.  It's not a useful description of how the world operates.  After all, we say that dice are \"random\" when we know perfectly well that classical mechanics tell us all we need to know to calculate how dice will land given initial conditions; it's just so complicated that we never bother.  Likewise, if the polarization of photons really is deterministic, it's almost impossible to imagine that it matters.  Hence, the sensible scientific conclusion is that some quantum mechanical processes are random (unlike dice, we cannot determine how they will go, have no leads on finding out, and have good evidence that our normal methods will fail).\nNow, back to your question: knowing that you don't know something is, of course, not a reason to say that something is false, or true, or unknowable.  But when you're trying to come up with a compact predictive framework to describe observations, the theory that lets you best deal with those things you can know, and lets you adequately work around that which you don't (or can't--even if you don't know whether it's \"don't\" or \"can't\"), is the superior theory.  Once that theory is shown to agree with many observations over long periods of time and under a wide range of conditions, it is pragmatic to accept that theory as true in the scientific sense (i.e. in the sense that it is \"true\" that you cannot fly by flapping your arms).\n"}]}

Even with the maximum theoretically available information we can't do better than calculate probabilities of various outcomes. \nThe other question is, does the fact that we are uncertain about something mean that it is not determinately true one way or the other?

And possibly futile.\nBut I'm not sure your question needs to bring in QM at all. Argument from an \"absence of knowledge\" is indeed an element of induction and a crucial assumption of science.\nThe argument that everything or, indeed, anything is \"causally determined\" is a claim of complete knowledge. Some Laplace machine can work out every possibility, with no room for randomness, \"clinamen,\" or miraculous intervention. Modern science (since statistical thermodynamics) never makes such absolute claims (no matter what individual scientists may say).\nThus the demonstration of a \"lack of knowledge\" does indeed \"disprove\" not any particular theory, but any claim that the theory implies concerning \"complete knowledge.\" Thus the inductive compromise. The theory is \"true for now,\" until its direct predictions are falsified. But it can never claim \"complete knowledge,\" even internally, and is thus validly limited by any and all claims of \"incomplete knowledge.\" \nAs an aside, the whole acceptance of \"lack of knowledge\" is central to the modern project. A good example is the way in which ancient maps were always filled up with fanciful dragons, chimera, netherworlds, and whatnot. It was only with modern exploration that maps became marked \"Unexplored,\" thus inviting empirical research. This is the cartographic innovation comparable to Kant's noumena. Until the \"lack of knowledge\" is admitted as a limit into the arguments, we have the futile contentions of a prior assertions.\nHow many of today's QM arguments fall into this realm of futile antinomy remains to be seen. Hidden variables may turn up.

At it's heart determinism is either partial or absolute.  if partial most would consider that evidence of either randomness or agency (free will, not necessarily ours).\nPhysics calls absolute determinism super-determinism (though I suspect philosophers would just call it determinism).  Bells inequalities are satisfiable via super-determinism as well as non-locality and randomness.\nIn summary the universe is either completely deterministic or it has some element of unpredictability which may be randomness or free will. The locality question links to this.  The more loopholes are closed the more complex and distant in time this entanglement must be (totally predicted by a deterministic universe) or some faster then light hidden variable must exist (no real evidence for this as I understand it) or the nature of randomness/unpredictability emerges at the quantum level.  Most physicists dismiss superdeterministic erroneously as they assume ruling out loopholes lowers its likelihood. The universe is under no obligation to be understandable to us and we assign probability based on the knowledge of an ensemble of outcomes.  We don't have that data for the nature of reality.\nWith the exception of a non-local variable (which actually pushes the determinism argument back a level rather then resolving it) the other two options are the same one philosophers proposed thousands of years ago. What physics has done is make it clear which descriptions are currently lacking.  Both classical mechanics and quantum mechanics currently fall into that category.

I'm asking a different question.  I'm asking about how to deal with uncertainty in an uncertain world and what practices do you adopt to navigate towards the truth and away from suboptimal conditions.  I am hoping that thousands of years of philosophy has the answer or at least a few contenders that a thoughtful human can use today.\nPut another way, what do the great philosophers say about the optimal way to think?  I have interests in machine learning so this question is important in that regard also.\nAlso, I'm aware of reinforcement learning and statistical models which work very well.  But, you still have to put these things together the right way.  I'm looking for some other insights that philosophy might be able to offer.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the scientific method is still the major way of assessing truth. It may not be as rigorously applied in the social sciences (the \"soft\" sciences, like philosophy, sociology, history, etc.) as it is in the natural sciences (\"hard\" sciences, like mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc.), but the underlying methodologies and motivations are all still there and all still intact. \nPerhaps you're wondering about logical proofs? Philosophical arguments are commonly made in this format, with the most common example being a syllogism. A syllogism presents two premises (or claims), and argues that the proposition (conclusion) must be logically inferred from those two premises. In other words, if you accept the premises, the conclusion must logically follow. For example:\n\nPremise One: Tom Jones asked a question on Philosophy\u2014Stack Exchange.\nPremise Two: People who ask questions on Philosophy\u2014Stack Exchange are smart and well-informed.\nConclusion: [Thus,] Tom Jones is smart and well-informed.\n\nThere are lots of other ways in which to frame a logical argument, ranging from the very simple to the very complex. At their highest level, logical proofs can look a lot like formal mathematical proofs because, well, they are the same. When reading standard philosophical treatises, you'll often find these arguments presented in words rather than in the more complex symbolic notation you might see in a formal logic textbook, but the methods and the process are all still the same. \nThe above example is actually an application of deductive reasoning, which can be more generally defined as reasoning from the general to the specific. Using such a logical framework, you make two (or more) claims about the world, and then attempt to show that a conclusion necessarily follows (or is logically implied) from those two premises. However, it's worth noting that deductive arguments are classified as either valid or invalid, not true or false.\nThe scientific method, by contrast, tends to follow the other prevailing method of reasoning, called inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning can be somewhat loosely defined as the reverse of deductive reasoning: reasoning from the specific to the general. Using the scientific method, one makes certain, specific observations about phenomena in the surrounding world, and then attempts to draw a more general conclusion based on those data. In this way, unlike deductive reasoning, it does work in search of truth, and an argument framed in this way can be dismissed as false (or untrue) given sufficient contradictory data.\nFinally, you should note that not all schools of philosophical thought have the pursuit of \"truth\" as their ultimate goal; in fact, such a goal lies in direct contradiction with many significant branches that would contest the very notion of \"truth\". They might argue that \"truth\" is simply unknowable, or they might argue that it is socially determined and therefore impossible to discuss objectively. \n"}]}

This consists of two parts:\n\nLogical: using a formal language to describe what you mean exactly and precisely, like when you program a computer.\nPositivism: making only statements about things that are subject to direct observation, or which can be reduced to these by a chain of definitions, so that you make sure you know what you are talking about.\n\nThe positivism is important, because it means that to give meaning to a question, you must reduce the terms to simpler definitions, until you reach either bedrock mathematical terms, like integers, or terms that can be defined by simple experience, like \"I see a white circle\".\nThe point of this exercise is that many superficially sensible questions are actually meaningless:\n\nIf the universe had a beginning, doesn't it require a cause?\nIf you will to move your arm, do your atoms determine the motion, or does your will?\nWhat is gravity made of?\n\nThese types of questions are too vague to be meaningful, and when formulated properly, are shown to be mostly meaningless, or else the answer becomes obvious. The revolutionary effects of positivism meant that essentially all the questions of classical philosophy were either answered or mooted. It also allowed Turing to identify mind with computation , an identification which resolved many of the philosophy of mind difficulties.\nAside from the computer revolution, which was mostly through events in mathematical logic which have some overlap with this--- Russell and Whitehead are significant for Godel--- the most radical world-altering consequences of this philosophy was in physics, where it was the central motivating idea behind at least four separate revolutionary ideas (with more examples if you go back further, and as many as you like if you go to less Earth shattering examples).\n\nRelativity\nQuantum Mechanics\nS-matrix theory (aka string theory)\nHolographic principle\n\nThere are more: here and here. Most of the questions non-physicists ask are very ignorant, because they do not have a training in positivism, so that they ask vague or meaningless questions.\nOnce you have a little training in positivism (it doesn't take long), the discourse of non-positivists, which includes nearly all contemporary philosophers, becomes worthless and pointless to read, since non-positivists do not know how to identify questions with one another, and so spend most of the time arguing about positivistically equivalent positions, or inconsequential meaningless things.\nRelativity (1900s)\nIn the 19th century, people believed in a lumineferous ether, a medium of light. Einstein showed that you could not measure your speed with respect to the ether, and therefore it is superfluous. Using positivism, he concludes that the ether is an unobservable entity, and therefore is meaningless. The ether was disproved in this way, the major step was positivism.\nErnst Mach developed philosophical positivism, along with important work in physics (the Mach number is named after him, since he studied supersonic fluid flow). Einstein admired and respected Mach, and made bold use of positivism in the early years.\nQuantum Mechanics (1920s)\nIn quantum mechanics, positivism is the most important ingredient. The act of defining a measuring device and a measurement as a separate aspect of the theory from the time evolution was due to the explicitly positivist outlook of Bohr and Heisenberg.\nThe major idea of making a matrix description of the electron came from renouncing the idea of a microscopic well defined orbit, in favor of quantities which determine the atomic transitions, which are all that we can observe. As Pauli and Heisenberg argued, if you can't determine where the electron is when it is in the ground state of Hydrogen, on the left of the nucleus or on the right, even in principle (at least not without knocking it out of the ground state), then this question is meaningless, and the location of the electron in its orbit in the ground state is meaningless.\nThe positivism is still central to the interpretation of the most common statement of the uncertainty principle. Because we cannot measure the position and momentum simultaneously, these quantities do not exist simultaneously. The modern formalism does not include position and momentum, but a wavefunction which gives probability amplitudes for either.\nS-matrix theory (1950s-1960s)\nIn the 1960s, physicists made the most radical positivist proposal you can imagine. The idea here was to renounce everything except for incoming and outgoing states in a scattering experiment, so that a physicist cannot describe events in space and time inbetween.\nTo make this clear: the S-matrix practitioners were saying that space is a reconstructed illusion, time is a reconstructed illusion (inasmuch as these statements are meaningful positivistically or mathematically), the only thing that is full meaningful to talk about are free cold particles in the infinite past, free cold particles in the infinite future, and an S-matrix to connect them.\nThis idea is manifestly absurd! It is the extreme of positivism. The S-matrix theory is inducting a principle: it is hard to make local measurements at a point in quantum field theory, and it is easy to do scattering experiments, so the idea that scattering is fundamental, and not space-time points. But this idea is completely crazy--- it means that fundamentally you can't talk about your own feet, or your grocery store, only about a large number of cold particles that come in to form the Earth and the Sun and everything else in the infinite past, and free cold particles in the infinite future, and an S-matrix that connects them (in one step).\nThis idea is so absurd, I could not accept it when I was a kid. I rebelled and rebelled against it, and I struggled to understand how sane people could believe this. Sidney Coleman explained it to me as follows:\n\nImagine you have some experiment that is not an S-matrix experiment. Imagine a robot doing the experiment. Assemble such a robot and some Hydrogen bombs from cold asymptotic particles, let the robot do the experiment, beam the results out in a photon beam to infinity, the detonate the H-bombs, so that the whole thing is blown into cold asymptotic particles. The S-matrix for that process includes the result of the experiment.\n\nThis was persuasive to me that the S-matrix was philosophically enough, but I could not be persuaded it was mathematically enough--- how do you reconstruct space and time from S-matrix?\nThis idea is positivism to the point of nihilism--- all space and time are rejected. This was a bit too radical for Feynman, but Gell-Mann could accept it, and helped found it and nurture it. The developments in the 1960s led to Regge theory and string theory, and it was realized by 1974 that S-matrix theory, in its string theory culmination, could only be a theory of everything, when Schwarz and Scherk made string theory a theory of everything.\nHolographic principle\nWithin string theory, and quantum gravity in general, the problem of black hole interiors was solved by a positivistic rejection of the black hole interior as separate from the exterior, since no observer can see both. The development of this principle refounded string theory, giving it a new founding principle, and at the same time explained the S-matrix theory, since the holographic description of space time turns into the S-matrix for flat spacetime with distant boundaries.\nThe holographic reconstruction of the interior from the boundary is the sensible way to understand how an S-matrix still encodes local physics. The idea is central to modern physics, in that the only theory we have of quantum gravity, is positivist to the point of nihilist--- it reconstructs everything from boundary data.\nRejection of positivism\nPhysicists are not immune to philosophical fasion, and between the years of 1974 and 1984, string theory was rejected essentially for the same reasons logical positivism was dying in other fields--- marijuana and New-Age thinking, plus a desire to revive the nice classical questions of philosophy about an objective world.\nThis is ridiculous reactionary nonsense, but it led to a decade of obscurity for string theory. In 1984, physicists picked up the theory, but not the positivism, nor the S-matrix origins. In the 1990s, the holographic principle gave new motivation to the S-matrix program, and in the last decade, S-matrix methods have been revived again in supergravity perturbation theory, and in studies of the pomeron by Polchinski, Tan, and collaborators.\nThis is a welcome relief--- positivism had almost been dealt the same blow that heliocentrism was dealt in Greek times--- death by stupidity.\n"}]}

Domestic violence law affects how the police behave towards citizens.  Sexual harassment law, highly influenced by the radical feminist Catherine Mackinnon, has affected not only how things work in academia, but also the workplace of countless organizations which influences workers in many, many ways.\nSpreading Misandry argues that ideological feminism, which includes radical feminism, has influenced popular and elite culture.  Parts of book lists such as this one probably also indicate the same.\nSanctifying Misandry shows how ideological feminism has affected theology.  Theology affects how religious leaders go about their business, which in turn affects how communities of people organize themselves. \nThe War Against Boys by feminist Christian Hoff Sommers shows how feminism has affected education and even elementary school teaching, and it comes as hard to see how radical feminism with its notion of a transhistorical patriarchy doesn't come as an influencing factor here also.\nPsychotherapy, via feminist therapy, if \"feminist therapy\" deserves the name therapy at all, consists of another realm of influence.\nI haven't seen a word of feminist Daphnae Patai's Heterophobia, but the blurb at Amazon and Nathanson and Young's commentary in Legalizing Misandry drawing on Patai indicate that she indicates that the idea of a transhistorical patriarchy has affected several areas mentioned above.     \n"}]}

Unlike most others on here, I'm what you'd call more of a \"stand-up philosopher\".  Seriously though, I think that you've misunderstood the film if you believe that the primary theme is virtual reality.  The \"matrix\" itself is merely a vehicle to tell a particular story, and to provide a context within which the machines can interact with humans on a level that the audience can relate to.  This was a film made more for the masses rather than the hard-core sf geek community, so having a computer spit out l33t text on a suspiciously unix-like screen just wouldn't cut the proverbial mustard. Therefore, the matrix provides context for the story, much like the starship Enterprise does in the Star Trek genre. \nThe themes are themselves quite obvious once you let yourself look beyond the really cool effects and the Kung-Fu. The primary ones being the struggle for freedom from slavery and for self-determination, self-sacrifice and selfless service for a greater cause. \nMuch of the first film has overtones of a struggle between good and evil which becomes more obviously defined by the last film, although since your question was about The Matrix then I suppose that my answer here should note that in the first film the positions of good and evil are very subjective and not entirely clear, even if you did find yourself sympathizing with the humans in the film and thus feeling that on the surface it was the humans representing the good and the machines the evil. That said, even by the last film, each character has acted entirely within it's own nature, so the good and evil themes are still quite \"muddied\" IMHO. \nThe \"thematic distraction\" of the classic good vs evil sub-plot seems to stem from another very strong theme which many might at first glance assume is about religion, but which I think is more about belief and faith.  I find that this is perhaps the stronger and more poignant theme in how it is played out. Firstly as depicted by Morpheus' unwavering faith in the Oracle's prophesies and his belief that Neo will turn out to be \"The One\", and secondly in the abilities of all of the bad-ass humans constantly wearing dark sunglasses who need only believe that they can do something in order to bend the rules of the Matrix to do some of the really cool jaw-dropping stuff. The first is a theme about having faith in others, and the second is all about believing in one's own self.\nOf course, we can try to draw a lot of really interesting philosophical stuff about the films, but personally I prefer to simply enjoy them as a really cool series of Sci-Fi Kung-Fu flicks with an awesome soundtrack!  :-)\nSalut.\n"}]}

There are people in this category; and yet there are many people who do not hold this view. Such people hold that there is an ontological difference between phenomenological experience and the physical firing of neurons one's brain. Prima facie, this seems to be a reasonable statement; after all, how could the firing of neurons be the same as the taste of an exquisite wine or the beauty of a dazzling sunset? This claim that there is a difference between \"mental\" states and brain (physical) states seems problematic to me after reflecting on it further.\nIt occurred to me that in order to make such a claim, one would have to know what both feel like. In other words, I can only distinguish between A and B if I know what A and B are. Just think about that for a moment. \nImagine a person asked you to compare an object, say, a banana, to another object, but he didn't tell you what the second object was. How could you begin to make any claims about the difference between the two objects? You couldn't.\n\nBoth sides agree in that all we get in our minds is one thing: phenomenological experience.

There is nothing to prevent a physicalist from making use of the notion of qualia; it is just that for the physicalist, qualia are reducible to physical  entities.  Everyone accepts that there is a phenomenal experience of seeing the color blue; the question is: is this experience reducible to neurons firing?\nAs you point out, there is no rigorous way to distinguish between the two-- we currently have no way to experience the color blue without neurons firing, nor do we have a way to have those neurons firing without seeing the color blue.  But, the fact that the two seem to always occur together (with a Humean regularity) does not permit us to attribute causality; we don't know if the phenomenal experience is epiphenomenal to the neurons firing, or if the neurons firing are epiphenomenal to the phenomenal experience.\nSo, the problem that you raise is not a problem with qualia (or purely a problem for those who hold that qualia are irreducible to physical states); the same problem faces the physicalist.  The reducibility of qualia to physical states likewise depends upon an ability to separate the two and declare one primary and the other epiphenomenal.\n"}]}

The disagreement by dualists has always been that neuronal activity is insufficient.\nThe kind of objections you mentioned about the taste of wine, etc. is not about the qualitative difference of experiencing one's c-fibres firing and the quale it's processing, but instead derived from the assumption that neural firings in general are a kind of automation. From Cog Sci (Kahneman, D. LaBerge) we know that automaticity is the opposite of attention. Attentive experience is precisely the kind of notion most dualists appear to have in mind when they're seeking to explain qualia-laden consciousness, so it seems uncharitable to think that they'd make such an incoherent statement as \"the quality of this activity which can provide experience and the quality of the contents of experience are ontologically different because they give rise to different experiences.\"\nTo take your example above, the dualist doesn't need to provide any difference between the banana and the unkowm object, because there's less of a likelihood that the unknown object is identical with the banana than that it's different - and all the more so when you want to discuss their ontological equivalence!

You could decide that the universe is an adiabatic reversible process (entropy = constant), or that it approaches adiabatic reversibility as you go further back in time.  You could postulate that there was some time in the past where the rules changed or things started.  Or you could devise a scheme where the system isn't closed, or assume that it's infinite (i.e. you can in principle push your entropy away to infinity to have whatever local entropy you like).  Since you only need at least one of these to be true for the 2nd law to not be problematic, you have a lot of wiggle room.\nThus, although the second law is an extremely important principle in physics, it's pretty inert philosophically.\n"}]}

The energy is the movement of the physical action.\nTaking the 1st law of thermodynamics into account: energy can neither be created or destroyed you could also say it is continuously converted.\nThe entropy as I understand it is the state of energy converted as work, so it can be concentrated (a bit like a dense bundle- or that extra strong shift of the heavy sofa) or scattered (like droplets or particles-re arranging the ornaments into position for example) which ever 'state' the energy remains the same expressed in work (concentrated on one big lift or scattered over duration across smaller items).\nAny conversion as an action has a duration (time) and every action converts potential energy into work, increasing the entropy from the last action of conversion.\nApplying this to humans (and theology is a human logos) you could interpret this that every action has a consequence between human beings. The action can be physical interaction and communication of information, opinion, ideas, concerns, etc...This would imply that humans all shape through the conversion of energy into work their world (natural and intangible) and I guess makes a case in theological and philosophical terms that the individual is a spec in the wider picture we call existence and 'reality'-and hence places responsibility onto each individual in being through action (existential philosophy: Heidegger on 'Dasein'.\nThe entropy in this case with an ever growing world population (and hence increasing conversion of existing energy into work) over time can only increase, which can be a bit disconcerting as it implies increase in diversity and quantity (difficult to control and bundle) some may call 'chaos' (Greek creation mythology: Chaos). On the other hand if you flip this the other way round and think what would therefore decrease entropy you come up with a nihilistic solution of self extinction we currently witness through the actions of terrorists. \nBaring in mind that the potential energy released at the beginning of time which formed the Universe (and in a truly macroscopic system that started with scientifically called the 'Big Bang', or 'Chaos' in mythology, God as the creator in Christian believes, etc...), and eventually our planet, life, on the 1st law of thermodynamics will always remain the same and the system (the Universe, planet Earth) would not be any worse off just differently transitioning and manifesting- if we as a species are no longer around.\nSo this means that it is very much in our own interest to sustaining ourselves, others and our World. The increase of entropy is inevitable, we should not focus on wasting our energy on changing and controlling this energy but 'go with the flow', more akin to non material existence as encountered in Eastern Philosophies and Religions, such as Taoism and Buddhism, Hinduism- or to decrease-go back in time.  \n"}]}

This is quite surprising, because life is recent in the history of the universe, while second principle of thermodynamic make us want to believe that the universe is getting closer and closer to its global equilibrium state. \nHow comes then, that \"complex life\" as us took so many times to emerge, if second law seems to go against it? Well, quite simply: their must exist some place in the universe that contains all the entropy required for living being to be, and complex structures to emerge. What are these places? They are our famous black holes. Black holes are the biggest well of entropy in the universe, and they took times to emerge. This is why, even though the second law of the universe seems to imply that the universe is getting more and more smooth and structureless, the existence of black holes allows him to actually complexify, even to make life a sustainable state of existence.\nConclusion: the second law of thermodynamics is against life, but the existence of black hole is here to sustain it.

Even in physics, Boltzmann's equation seems more like a mathematical \"truce\" than an ontological clincher. Assuming there is a role in our metaphysics for some sort of temporal consciousness or \"Sein und Zeit,\" etc., we have innumerable issues raised by the Second Law. These assume their most compelling form in Maxwell's Demon, which I believe even Maxwell presented as a puzzler dealing with the nature of \"mind\" or \"mental work.\" I am not competent to assess the various models of the demon proposed over the years. But I believe the most intriguing, in relation to res cogitans, is the one offered by Landauer, in which the demon can indeed reverse entropy in its little world as long as it can keep \"remembering\" what it defines as order, even as that order changes. As long as it can still \"tell the difference.\" The problem comes with memory storage, the demon's \"historical\" account, so to speak. At some point it must physically clear or erase its memory. And this, as Landauer shows, is what requires external energy, more energy than the demon's efforts can conserve. The vague resemblance between the demon and the transcendental subject is intriguing. So how exactly does this impact metaphysics? Um, I'll get back to you in a few years, if I can remember how. \n"}]}

Moreover, a closed system is something physically impossible. The problem of such approach, as a teacher used to say, is this:\nNature is essentially change, and according to our perception, such change has two forms: organization and dissipation (statism is just an ideal, a macrostate, something that is only provided by perception; states are mental interpretations, whilst nature is pure change). So:\n\nDissipation is described by the second law of thermodynamics. The second law can be read as \"energy tends to dissipate\" (see the formulae!). If nature would behave only according to the second law, everything would have already dissipated.\nWe don't know a rule that would describe organization. If we would reach such milestone, perhaps we would be able to create a living entity from scratch.\n\nSo, while some natural manifestations produce dissipation, others produce organization. Existence is the result of both. Given that we exist and that life tends to get more complex and sustainable, it would seem that nature features more organization than dissipation, but evidently, such is just an speculation.\nAnyway, asking the philosophical implications of a rule isolated from the rest of natural behaviors, has no sense, is just like trying an interpretation of an incomplete equation, say, \" E= \".\n"}]}

If I define a werewolf as:\n\nLarge teeth\nClaws\nHuman by day\nWolf by night\nChanges during a full moon\n\nI would not be unjustified in saying that werewolves, by definition, have all of these characteristics. That's not to say that there are any entities in reality that exist with these characteristics, but nonetheless werewolves are still defines by these tenets. Also, I'm certainly not a Platonist, so I don't believe that werewolves exist in another 'realm' simply because they have a concept, but they do, indeed, have defined characteristics, despite not existing in nature.\nTL;DR\nAll things, not limited to physical items but conceptual models as well, have definite characteristics even if they do not or can not exist within reality. For example, a square with three sides has definite characteristics, namely it is square and has only three sides, yet it is inherently contradictory and cannot manifest in reality. We differentiate them based on these characteristics, and existence becomes irrelevant.\n"}]}

How can I know the difference between ghosts and werewolves if neither exist?\nBecause knowing is something that takes place in either the brain or mind, and the brain/mind is capable of creative thinking about imaginary things that do not materially exist.\nQ. How is it possible for things that do not exist to not be the same? \nBecause imaginary or real, all things have properties that are universals rather than particulars (sometimes called the essence)- so a man may be tall in relation to a child, but short compared to a giraffe. Tallness is not to be found in the man himself.\nUnicorns, though imaginary share universals with horses, and partly with antelopes, or similar horned animals. Werewolves share universals with men and wolves.\nSameness is yet another universal, maybe equal to a set of universals denoting similarity, so it can fail to apply to any pair of particulars, real or imaginary, or even particular types.    \nQ. How can one differentiate nonexistent entities? \nEither by an act of pure imagination, or by real world modelling, which also requires some imagination. For example one might model the Three Billy Goats Gruff with real life goats of various sizes and attempt to sieve them to find the largest.\nEven coding a virtual reality to model the nonexistent entities could work, in principle, but someone needs to imagine their properties first. \nAnd as for impossible entities, as opposed to imaginary entities, such as the 3 sided square mentioned in earlier answers, we just have to think of the illusions in pictures by Escher to see that there are ways in which the impossible becomes imaginable.\n"}]}
